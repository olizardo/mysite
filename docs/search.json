    "text": "Early Life\nI was born in New York City, spent the better part of the first 17 years of my life in a (then) small coastal city called La Romana (i.e. “The Roman” with feminine inflection) on the Southeast corner of Dominican Republic, and have lived in the U.S. ever since.\n\n\nAcademic Training\nI earned a Bachelor of Science in Psychology from Brooklyn College in 1997. Starting in the year 2000, I enrolled in the graduate program in the Department of Sociology at the University of Arizona, where I was fortunate to earn a Ph.D. in 2006 under the supervision and mentorship of Ron Breiger and Al Bergesen.\n\n\nEarly Academic Career\nStarting in 2006, I had the privilege to spend the first twelve years of my academic career in the Department of Sociology at the University of Notre Dame. I was promoted to Associate Professor with tenure in 2012, and to Full Professor in 2016. While at Notre Dame, I was selected as co-editor, with Rory McVeigh and Sarah Mustillo, of the American Sociological Review, the flagship journal of the American Sociological Association (ASA), for a five-year term starting in 2015. In 2014, received the Lewis Coser Award for Theoretical Agenda Setting from the ASA’s Section on Theory.\n\n\nRecent Academic Career\nIn 2018, I decided to make the transition to the West (best) coast and moved to California, where I am currently a ladder faculty member and LeRoy Neiman Term Chair Professor in the Department of Sociology at UCLA. While at UCLA, I was elected a member of the Sociological Research Association in 2019. In 2020, I was appointed to the Board of Review Editors for the journal Science."

    "title": "Bonacich Centrality and the Method of Reflections",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In a previous post, I showed how the “method of reflections” introduced by Hidalgo & Hausmann (2009)—hereafter HH—works in the case of two-mode network data. While reading that, some of you might have thought that there is a well-established network centrality metric for two-mode networks that is supposed to work just like the method of reflections: That is, defining the centrality of entities in one mode (e.g., persons) according to centralities of the entities in the other mode (e.g., groups). I refer to the Bonacich “eigenvector” centrality—see Bonacich (1991) and Faust (1997) for discussion.\nIn this post I show how the Bonacich centrality fits into the reflection idea, and why this means it is a different metric from that yielded by HH’s reflection method. This also the difference between Bonacich and Correspondence Analysis (CA), because the HH reflection method is equivalent to CA.\nConsider an affiliation matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) of dimensions \\(|P| \\times |G|\\) where \\(|P|\\) is the cardinality of the person set and \\(|G|\\) the cardinality of the group set in the two-mode network. Each entry in the matrix \\(a_{pg} = 1\\) if person p affiliates with group \\(g\\) and zero otherwise. An affiliation matrix of this type, representing Davis et al.’s (1941) famous Southern Women data, is shown as Table 1.\nIn this case, the degree centrality of people is given by:\n\\[\n   C^B_p(1) = \\sum_g a_{pg}\n\\tag{1}\\]\nAnd for groups:\n\\[\n   C^B_g(1) = \\sum_p a_{pg}\n\\tag{2}\\]\nThe right hand sides of Equation 1 and Equation 2 are just the first order degree centralities of people and groups (Faust, 1997). People are central when they have many memberships and groups are central when they have many members.\nOnce we have this information, we can define a second order “Bonacich-reflection” on both the persons and groups using the formulas:\n\\[\n   C^B_p(2) = \\sum_g a_{pg}C^R_g(1)\n\\tag{3}\\]\n\\[\n   C^B_g(2) = \\sum_p a_{pg}C^R_p(1)\n\\tag{4}\\]\nEquation 3 says that people are central when the sum of the number of members of the groups they belong to is large. Equation 4 says groups are central when the sum of the number of memberships of the people who belong to them is large.\nWe can keep on going and define a third order reflection using the formulas:\n\\[\n   C^B_p(3) = \\sum_g a_{pg}C^R_g(2)\n\\tag{5}\\]\n\\[\n   C^B_g(3) = \\sum_p a_{pg}C^R_p(2)\n\\tag{6}\\]\nEquation 5 says that people are central when the sum of the sum of the number of memberships held by the people who belong to the groups they belong to is large. Equation 5 says that groups are central when the sum of the sum of the number of members of the groups their members belong to is large.\nOnce again, we can keep going and define fourth order, fifth order, and higher reflections \\(C^R_p(4), C^R_p(4) \\ldots C^R_p(q)\\).\nMore generally, the reflective Bonacich centralities for persons and groups are given by:\n\\[\n   C^B_p(q) = \\sum_g a_{pg}C^R_g(q-1)\n\\tag{7}\\]\n\\[\n   C^B_g(q) = \\sum_p a_{pg}C^R_p(q-1)\n\\tag{8}\\]\nFor all q > 1.\nActually, the preceding set of equations won’t quite work, because we are computing sums of sums, of sums which means that both the person and group reflective Bonacich centralities would diverge toward infinity as \\(q\\) increases.\nTo prevent this divergence and guarantee convergence to a set of manageable scores after a few iterations, we need to normalize the sum of centralities at each step \\(q > 1\\) before feeding them to the subsequent sum at step \\(q+1\\). We do this by dividing the computed centrality vectors for both persons and group at each step q by a vector norm, which in this case is the Euclidean vector norm, as follows:\n\\[\n   C^B_p(q) = \\frac{C^B_p(q)}{||C^B_p(q)||_2}\n\\tag{9}\\]\n\\[\n   C^B_p(q) = \\frac{C^B_p(q)}{||C^B_p(q)||_2}\n\\tag{10}\\]\nWith the Euclidean norm for each centrality vector defined as:\n\\[\n   ||C^B_p(q)||_2 = \\sqrt{\\sum_i^{|P|}(C^B_p(q)_i)^2}\n\\tag{11}\\]\n\\[\n   ||C^B_g(q)||_2 = \\sqrt{\\sum_j^{|G|}(C^B_g(q)_j)^2}\n\\tag{12}\\]\nLet’s see how that looks like with real data. The results of the reflection equations for the Southern Women data, for people up to twenty reflections, are shown in Table 2. The corresponding results for groups are shown in Table 3.\nWe can see that the results for both persons and groups freeze into values after a few iterations. The resulting final ranks of persons and groups are shown in Table 4 (a) and Table 4 (b).\nThe final rankings of both persons and groups should look familiar, for they are equivalent to the “dual” Bonacich centralities that can be calculated directly using methods from linear algebra as detailed in Bonacich (1991). That is, consider the standard one-mode person and group projections, which can be obtained from the original affiliation matrix as discussed in Breiger (1974).\nThese are given by:\n\\[\nB_p = AA^T\n\\tag{13}\\]\n\\[\nB_g = A^TA\n\\tag{14}\\]\nWhere \\(B_p\\) is the \\(|P| \\times |P|\\) person projection matrix (with off-diagonal cells indicating the number of groups two people have in common and diagonal cells indicting each person’s number of memberships), \\(B_g\\) is the \\(|G| \\times |G|\\) group projection matrix (with off-diagonal cells indicating the number of people two groups have in common and diagonal cells indicting each group’s number of members), and \\(A\\) is the original affiliation matrix. For both persons and groups the projection matrices are shown in Table 5 (a) and Table 5 (b).\nBonacich shows that vectors that will order people and groups in the same way as that shown in Table 4, can be obtained by solving the following system of linear equations:\n\\[\nB_p c_p = \\lambda c_p\n\\tag{15}\\]\n\\[\nB_g c_g = \\lambda c_g\n\\tag{16}\\]\nWhich means that \\(c_p\\) is an eigenvector of the projection matrix \\(B_p\\) and \\(c_g\\) is an eigenvector of the projection matrix \\(B_g\\). In fact, the person and group vectors of centrality scores that will order people and groups exactly as in Table 4, are the leading (first) eigenvectors of each respective projection matrix (Bonacich, 1991; Faust, 1997). These are shown in Table 6. As we can see, the (absolute) value for the eigenvectors of persons and groups in Table 6 is identical to that shown in Table 4. The reason for this is that the reflective iterative method, is actually a way of computing the eigenvectors of a matrix! (It’s called the “power” method and was first discovered by von Mises)"

    "title": "Using Simple Correspondence Analysis to Present Tabular Data",
    "section": "",
    "text": "CA and Tabular Bias\nOftentimes, Simple Correspondence Analysis (hereafter CA) is presented as a complex, almost mystical technique, and its association with a relatively obscure data-analytic school in France and later Bourdieu’s Distinction does not help. This is a pity since CA is actually a quantitative data reduction technique that is perfect for presenting qualitative data. Particularly in data from samples typically seen in work by ethnographers, interviewers, small-sample content analysts, and historical sociologists.\nTypically, these researchers will present key pieces of data in tabular form, and ask the readers to use a lot of brainpower to detect patterns by staring at numbers when it would be much easier to do a simple CA and present the categories in the rows and columns of the table as a biplot of the first two-dimensions of a simple CA. I present three examples from published work showing this “tabular bias” and show how CA could have improved things greatly (and maybe revealed some insights).1 Note that picked these three articles not to drag them, but because I liked them quite a lot, and saw potential for them to be even better than they are.\n\n\nExample I: Journals and Theory Diagrams\n\n\n\nIn a fascinating piece, Brett et al. (2020) study the ways sociologists use diagrams to visualize theory ideas. They selected seven primarily or heavily “theoretical” journals in sociology (p. 227), and coded the “theory figures” included in a random sample of papers from each journal. The theory figure codes aimed at specifying what sort of visual languages authors used to construct the visualizations (e.g., boxes, arrows, geometrical figures, Venn diagrams, and the like). The tabular data is presented as an Appendix (A) to the paper. A two-mode table cross-classifying journals by the characteristics of the theory figures they typically publish These data are reproduced in Table 1. The table has seven rows (for the journals) and eleven columns (for the theory figure motifs)\n\n\n\n\nTable 1:  Table of journals by theory figure characteristics. \n \n  \n      \n    Arrows \n    Circles \n    Boxes \n    Lines \n    Triangles \n    Zig-Zags \n    Legend \n    Reading-Rules \n    Path-Diag. \n    Venn-Diag. \n    Con-Circles \n  \n \n\n  \n    AJS \n    7 \n    5 \n    3 \n    5 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    3 \n    1 \n    0 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    ASR \n    11 \n    4 \n    5 \n    19 \n    3 \n    1 \n    6 \n    11 \n    10 \n    1 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    EJS \n    14 \n    3 \n    14 \n    24 \n    1 \n    0 \n    3 \n    9 \n    10 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    EJST \n    9 \n    5 \n    5 \n    5 \n    4 \n    0 \n    0 \n    2 \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    ST \n    36 \n    34 \n    34 \n    24 \n    1 \n    4 \n    15 \n    3 \n    7 \n    17 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    TCS \n    5 \n    6 \n    6 \n    9 \n    3 \n    0 \n    2 \n    6 \n    2 \n    3 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    TS \n    23 \n    12 \n    12 \n    20 \n    0 \n    0 \n    8 \n    3 \n    9 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bulk of Brett et al.’s paper is concerned with specific examples, and the point is to delve into these to diagnose various problems in the ways sociologists use theory pictures (and end with some really good advice). Brett et al. were not concerned with the relationship between different journals and theory figure motifs, although they could have presented such data in a clear way by using a CA visualization of the table presented in the appendix. This is shown in Figure 1.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: CA Visualization of the table of journals by theory figure characteristics.\n\n\n\n\nThe Figure shows that the distribution of theory figure motifs across theory journals is not random, which would be hard to tell from eyeballing the numbers in Table 1. Indeed, there is a pattern across journals, separating, on the main horizontal dimension, the American Sociological Review (ASR) and the European Journal of Sociology (EJS) on the one end from Sociological Theory (ST) at the other end. ASR and EJS are awash in lines and path diagrams, while ST traffics heavily in circles (concentric and otherwise), zig-zags, boxes, and Venn diagrams. The American Journal of Sociology (AJS), square in the middle, balances between these two tendencies. On the other hand, the second dimension separates the European Journal of Social Theory (EJST), which somehow gravitates towards triangles, from Theory & Society, which likes legends. The arrows theory figure motif is neutral across journals, being placed close to the origin of the plot.2\n\n\nExample 2: Early Modern Authors in Economics\nErikson & Hamilton (2018)—hereafter EH—discuss how early modern economic thought arose from the practical reflections of people directly involved in trade, particularly international trade. As evidence consistent with this claim, they argue that authors of early modern economics texts were disproportionately more likely to be recruited from certain classes, trades, and stations (e.g., merchants, especially those involved in international trade in chartered companies) as compared to others (Gentry, Army types). This merchant connection is supposed to strengthen over time (going from the sixteenth into the seventeenth century).\n\n\n\n\nTable 2:  Table of time periods by classes of early modern economics authors. \n \n  \n      \n    Noble \n    Gentry \n    Clergy \n    Military \n    Professional \n    Merchant \n    Yeoman \n  \n \n\n  \n    1550 \n    0 \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    1570 \n    0 \n    1 \n    2 \n    0 \n    14 \n    2 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    1590 \n    3 \n    4 \n    9 \n    1 \n    32 \n    6 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    1610 \n    4 \n    10 \n    16 \n    7 \n    35 \n    15 \n    2 \n  \n  \n    1630 \n    14 \n    38 \n    28 \n    22 \n    66 \n    38 \n    3 \n  \n  \n    1650 \n    22 \n    48 \n    40 \n    28 \n    103 \n    68 \n    11 \n  \n  \n    1670 \n    41 \n    49 \n    47 \n    12 \n    126 \n    65 \n    22 \n  \n  \n    1690 \n    123 \n    94 \n    97 \n    5 \n    222 \n    255 \n    3 \n  \n  \n    1710 \n    56 \n    48 \n    63 \n    5 \n    151 \n    205 \n    7 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nA key piece of evidence in this regard is presented in two-mode tabular form (Table 7, p. 140), reproduced here as Table Table 2. The table cross-classifies ten time periods by seven classes of economics authors. EH invite the reader to gaze at the numbers to reach the desired conclusion (e.g, that there are more merchants in later periods). I argue that the reader would have reached the conclusion faster and would have been even more convinced of their argument if they had used CA to present the results of their cross-classification. The reader may have also noticed patterns that are impossible to see by staring at the table. This is shown in Figure 2.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: CA Visualization of the table of time periods by classes of early modern economics authors.\n\n\n\n\nThe figure shows evidence consistent with EH’s claims. Indeed, Merchants end up near the upper-left-hand quadrant of the two-dimensional space, nearer the last two periods (1690-1710), indicating that they dominated the discussion during this era. They are maximally contrasted with authors with a military background (who are naturally better represented in more bellicose periods) and authors with a Yeoman background (who are better represented in the late sixteenth century). The CA also reveals insights not evident in the tabular presentation. First, Noblemen were also better represented among economics authors in the later period, even if they were less numerous than merchants. Second, clergymen are more or less evenly represented across periods, ending close to the plot’s origins.\n\n\nExample 3: Relationship Between Class and Mode of Aesthetic Self-Presentation\nIn a fascinating paper, van den Haak and Wilterdink (2019)—hereafter HW—analyze interview data from a sample of ninety Dutch people more or less evenly divided into three groups by class situation: Stayers in the less educated stratum, stayers in the more educated stratum, and movers from the low to the high educated stratum. HW asked these people about their cultural tastes, other people’s cultural tastes, and whether there was such a thing as good or bad taste.\n\n\n\n\nTable 3:  Class status by mode of aesthetic self-presentation. \n \n  \n      \n    Only hierarchical \n    Only egalitarian \n    Both: ambivalent \n    Neither: neutral \n  \n \n\n  \n    Stayers (High Educ.) \n    2 \n    6 \n    22 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Movers (Low to High) \n    5 \n    3 \n    20 \n    2 \n  \n  \n    Stayers (Less Educ.) \n    1 \n    13 \n    13 \n    3 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you might imagine, this interview schedule resulted in a lot of “who am I to judge,” “to each their own,” “I wouldn’t want to sound rude,” and so forth. But the surprising thing is that HW also found that some non-substantial minority was unafraid to be judgy while the bulk of their sample shifted between judgy and “who am I…” discourses sometimes in the middle of the same thought!\nSo HW went back and coded their interview data (divided into the aforementioned classes) into different aesthetic self-presentation groups: People unafraid to produce hierarchical judgments of taste (e.g., “this type of culture is better than that other”), people who consistently stuck to the “who am I…, and to each…” script (egalitarians), and people who wavered between these two (ambivalents). There was also a neutral category for those who didn’t use any of these discourses.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: CA Visualization of the table of class status by mode of aesthetic self-presentation.\n\n\n\n\nHW presented their results in (their) Table 1 (p. 422), reproduced here (rows and columns switched) as Table 3. In summarizing their results, HW note that “[a]s Table 1 specifies, the well-educated are clearly over-represented in the hierarchical type and the (much larger) category of the ambivalent type, whereas the less-educated make up larger proportions of the egalitarian and the neutral categories (p. 422).” This is definitely what the table shows, but it is not as evident as HW think because, well, table. A CA of the table would show the result in a better way. Moreover, CA is particularly efficient at summarizing results of two-way tables with a relatively small number of cases like Table 3.\nThe results are shown in Figure 3. Indeed, stayers among the educated stratum are the most likely to use the ambivalent discourse in HW’s data. In the same way, stayers in the less educated stratum are more consistently egalitarian (in nuanced ways that are better detailed in the paper) and closer to the neutral pole (upper-right quadrant).\nHowever, what the CA plot also shows that is not that evident in the table is that movers into the educated stratum are also the most consistently hierarchical, perhaps in line with Bourdieu’s original thesis that latecomers into cultural capital tend to adopt the party line in more rigid and less flexible forms—as detailed in Lizardo (2018).\n\n\nConclusion\nRhetorically, sociology is way past the “methods wars” that characterized the bad old days. Mixed methods are quite normal, and people are used to deploying strategies that cross the qual/quant divide to answer questions and present data. Yet, some practices are encrusted in tradition, particularly using tabular data to present results. Both qualitative and quantitative people use them, but most of the time, a picture will be better.\nOne reason is that a two-way, two-mode table is a many-dimensional object (with as many dimensions as cells in the underlying matrix represented in the table). It needs some dimensionality reduction to be made comprehensible. People often reduce the dimensions informally (directing the reader’s attention to a particular column or percentage cell), but that means they are bound to miss non-obvious patterns.\nCA can be used for many purposes, but the two things it is really good at are (1) reducing dimensionality usually to \\(d = 2\\), and (2) visualizing this reduction in a synoptic diagram (what Bourdieu loved about it). This conserves cognitive economy and maximizes impact. In the olden days, CA was an obscure method ensconced in obscure software (if available at all). Today, it is just a click away from the interface in all the popular data analysis programs (like R in the present case).\nSo whenever the urge to present something as a table occurs, especially at a key point in a paper, ask yourself: Wouldn’t CA tell a better story here? I bet, in most cases, it will.\n\n\nReferences\nBrett, G., Silver, D., & Beelen,, K. (2020). The right tool for the job: problems and solutions in visualizing sociological theory.

Carrington, John McLevey, and John Scott)—see here for an uncorrected draft—I argue that there intimate links between recent work on cultural networks, duality, and cultural holes, and recent work in the categories literature dealing with fuzziness of categorization, atypicality, and variety in cultural choices.\nThis conceptual linkage is one that was initially noted and developed by Balazs Kocavs in a couple of papers (see here and here) in the early 2010s, but which has not been pursued or developed of late. This is despite the fact that work on categories pursues relentless mathematical formalization, but in a language and style that either obscure or do not make very intuitive its link to formal approaches in the cultural networks tradition based on the ideas of duality and two-mode network analysis (Mützel & Breiger, 2020).\nIn the chapter I argue that particularly that the various conceptual distinctions and measures proposed in Goldberg et al.’s 2016 paper on category atypiticaly, variety, and cultural boundary spanning can be given a familiar representation using tools from the analysis of cultural networks. The argument in the chapter is mostly informal. The purpose of this post is to provide a more formal treatment and extension of some of the ideas discussed in the chapter."

This requires coming up with a criterion for defining interlabel distances, which are themselves based on some criterion for interlabel similarity.\nIn terms of two-mode network analysis, this boils down to taking the one mode projection of the (\\(\\mathbf{B}\\)) matrix:\n\\[\n     LL = B^TB\n\\tag{1}\\]\nThe square matrix \\(\\mathbf{LL}\\) contains the number of objects shared by each pair of labels \\((i,j)\\) in the off-diagonals, and the number of objects covered by each label in the diagonals. The Jaccard (J) similarity measure proposed by Goldberg et al. (eq. 1) is a function of these quantities, and thus can be written as:\n\\[     \n     J_{ij} = \\frac{LL_{ij}}{LL_{ii} + L_{jj} - LL_{ij}}\n\\tag{2}\\]\nBut of course, so are many other measures of similarity, such as cosine, Dice, min-overlap, max-overlap, and the like. All can be defined from quantities obtained from the one-mode label \\(\\times\\) label network obtained from the projection of the original object \\(\\times\\) label network.\nOnce we have a measure of similarity, inter-label distances are obtained by some transformation of label similarities, such that similar objects are close and dissimilar objects are far (Goldberg et al. use a negative exponential function due to Shepard). Distances, in this sense, are derivative of quantities obtained from the one-mode network projection."

So, when the weights are similarities, typical objects have high “constraint” in their cultural ego network—in Burt’s sense as defined by Lizardo (2014)—with their label alters strongly linked to one another. Atypical objects, on the other hand have low constraint, with their label alters weakly tied to one another. So this is another way of saying that atypical objects span cultural holes in the interlabel network (see Figure 1)."

That’s exactly what Goldberg et al. do, but they don’t characterize it quite that way.\nSo, people’s taste for variety is just the average atypicality of the objects they choose, suitably weighted by their rating of the object if such information is available (see Goldberg et al. eq. 7), such that only objects for which the person displays a positive (after sampling) evaluation count."

Basically, the idea is that variety seeking can be measured using information on “the average distance of the objects consumed [by people] and that variety seeking means liking pairs of objects that stand far apart in the cultural space” (Goldberg et al. 2016, p. 224).\nHere Goldberg et al. get into some over-complication territory, since they insist on using “cultural space” information to define the inter-object similarities (distances). But then get hung up on the fact that sometimes the label set sizes of different objects are not the same (in our terms, objects cultural ego network sizes are different), and they want to compare distances across sets of different sizes and so forth to define inter-object distances.\nOddly, they ignore the lowest hanging fruit to defining inter-object similarities (and by implication distances). Had they been more attuned to the principle of duality they would have realized they actually had two choices:\n\\[     \n     OO_1 = A^TA\n\\tag{3}\\]\n\\[\n     OO_2 = BB^T\n\\tag{4}\\]\nMatrix \\(OO_1\\) would contain the basic quantities to compute inter-object similarities based on audience overlap. Matrix \\(OO_2\\) would contain the basic quantities to compute inter-object similarities based on inter-label overlap. The first approach is the one pursued by Lizardo (2014) for cultural object genre labels. Goldberg et al. use label distance information to define the inter-object similarity (distance) network, which is fine, so they opt for a complicated version of the projection approach, based on set theoretic distance measures between the label sets assigned to each pair of objects that account for different sizes across the pairs of sets being compared.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Varieties of monism.\n\n\nA more straightforward approach based on duality—like that pursued by Kovacs (2010) in other work—would have just said that objects are (similar) distant in cultural space to the extent they get assigned overlapping (different) labels. Any of the similarity measures (Jaccard, cosine, Dice) applied pairwise to the cells of the \\(OO_2\\) matrix would have yielded that information in a more intuitive way that Goldberg et al’s “modified Hausdorff distance” (Goldberg et al., eqs. 8-9) approach."

    "text": "The Taste for Variety\nIn any case, once an interobject similarity (distance) network is obtained (preferably by the simpler duality approach), then we can loop back to the people and define their taste for variety similarly to how atypicality is defined for objects (this is what Goldberg et al. ultimately end up doing too).\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Strong poly-purism.\n\n\nPeople who seek variety have a cultural ego-network surrounded by objects who are themselves dissimilar (get assigned non-overlapping labels); people who don’t seek variety consume objects who get assigned overlapping labels. Thus, people bridge cultural holes in the variety sense, when they consume categorically distinct pairs of objects.\nUltimately, we can see why Goldberg et al.’s approach yields empirically and analytically distinct measures of boundary spanning based on atypicality-seeking and variety-seeking. In the atypicality case, even an “univore” can cross cultural boundaries, by consuming a single atypical object, like riot grrrl jazz (mono-mixer). In the same way an expansive “omnivore” in terms of volume of choices can fail to span boundaries, by consuming many categorically indistinct objects. Of course, both strategies can be combined yielding a second way to span boundaries, consuming many atypical objects (poly-mixer); finally, a person can like variety while abhorring atypicality yielding yet a third way of crossing boundaries (poly-purist).\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Weak poly-purism.\n\n\nWe can represent these distinct consumer types using the proposed three-mode network imagery. For instance, the different types of “mono” consumers (people with a relatively low taste for variety) are shown in Figure 2. The “mono-mixer” (Figure 2 (a)) is a person who chooses one, albeit highly atypical, genre as given by the low similarity between the labels assigned to it. So while they connect to only a single object, they indirectly connect to multiple (weakly related) labels via that object.\nThe mono-purist comes in two flavors (only implicitly distinguished in Goldberg et al.). The first (Figure 2 (b)) is the “purest” mono-purist: A person who chooses objects most representative of their types (single-labeled objects). Then there is a relatively weaker form of mono-purism: Picking a multi-labeled object whose labels are strongly related to one another (Figure 2 (c)).\nThe same approach can be used to distinguish between different forms of poly-purism. First, there is the strong poly-purist (Figure 3), who only consumes (and likes) objects that are the strongest representatives of their categories, as given by their single label assignment, and the relative dissimilarities between labels across objects consumed. Then there is a weaker form of poly-purism (Figure 4); a consumer who would countenance multi-labeled objects, as long as they are still typical members of their categories, as given by the strong similarities between the labels assigned, and the relative dissimilarities across label sets between objects (a similar approach could be used to define strong and weak varieties of poly-mixing)."

That is, actors should receive more similarity ``points’’ if they connect to objects that are themselves similar. It thus fails to respect the principle of equivalence."

To this end, consider a matrix \\(\\mathbf{S(O)}\\) with cell entries \\(s(o)_{ij}\\) capturing pairwise similarities between the objects in the two-mode network. In this case, a generalized relational similarity (GRS) measure for actors based on the correlation distance can be expressed as:\n\\[\n   D(A)^{grs}_{i,j} =\n    \\frac{\n    (M_{i\\bullet} - \\bar{M_{i\\bullet}})\n    \\mathbf{S(O)}\n    (M_{j\\bullet} - \\bar{M_{j\\bullet}})^T\n    }\n    {\n    \\sqrt{\n    (M_{i\\bullet} - \\bar{M_{i\\bullet}})\n    \\mathbf{S(O)}\n    (M_{i\\bullet} - \\bar{M_{i\\bullet}})^T\n    }\n    \\sqrt{\n    (M_{j\\bullet} - \\bar{M_{j\\bullet}})\n    \\mathbf{S(O)}\n    (M_{j\\bullet} - \\bar{M_{j\\bullet}})^T\n        }\n    }\n\\tag{2}\\]\nKovacs notes that if we have access to an analogous matrix of similarities between actors \\(\\mathbf{S(A)}\\) in the network, then we would be able to also calculate a generalized relational similarity score for objects \\(D(O)^{grs}\\) by plugging in that matrix and the column profiles and means into equation Equation 2, yielding:\n\\[\n   D(O)^{grs}_{i,j} =\n    \\frac{\n    (M_{\\bullet i} - \\bar{M_{\\bullet i}})\n    \\mathbf{S(A)}\n    (M_{\\bullet i} - \\bar{M_{\\bullet i}})^T\n    }\n    {\n    \\sqrt{\n    (M_{\\bullet i} - \\bar{M_{\\bullet i}})\n    \\mathbf{S(A)}\n    (M_{\\bullet i} - \\bar{M_{\\bullet i}})^T\n    }\n    \\sqrt{\n    (M_{\\bullet j} - \\bar{M_{\\bullet j}})\n    \\mathbf{S(A)}\n    (M_{\\bullet j} - \\bar{M_{\\bullet j}})^T\n        }\n    }\n\\tag{3}\\]\nTypically, people only have access to the network information and not exogenous indication of pre-existing similarities between actors or objects, required to compute Equation 2, and Equation 3. Kovacs’s (ingenious) solution is to use the duality property and compute “reflective similarities” by obtaining initial object similarities plugging \\(D(A)^{cor}\\) into Equation 3, equivalent to substituting the identity matrix, of dimensions \\(O \\times O\\), into the slot occupied by \\(\\mathbf{S(O)}\\) in Equation 2. Then, in a second step, using the resulting actor similarities to compute generalized object similarities. This is done by substituting an \\(A \\times A\\) matrix of \\(D(A)^{grs}\\) values obtained in the first step into the slot occupied by \\(\\mathbf{S(A)}\\) in Equation 3. The iterations continue until both \\(D(A)^{grs}\\) and \\(D(A)^{grs}\\) “freeze” according to some stopping criterion (\\(\\epsilon\\)).\nIt is easy to see that Equation 2 and Equation 3 both respect the principle of equivalence. Actors count as similar to the extent they connect to similar objects (\\(\\mathbf{S(O)}\\)). Conversely, objects count as similar to the extent they are chosen by similar actors ($ $).\nBecause the similarities are defined according to the dual projection method, in which the similarity of actors is based on the objects they choose, and the similarity of objects is based on the actors who choose them, Equation 2 and Equation 3 also respect the principle of duality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE1\nE2\nE3\nE4\nE5\nE6\nE7\nE8\nE9\nE10\nE11\nE12\nE13\nE14\n\n\n\n\nEVELYN\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\nLAURA\n1\n1\n1\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\nTHERESA\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\nBRENDA\n1\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\nCHARLOTTE\n0\n0\n1\n1\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\nFRANCES\n0\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\nELEANOR\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\nRUTH\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n0\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\nVERNE\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n\n\nMYRA\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n\n\nKATHERINE\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n1\n0\n1\n1\n1\n\n\nSYLVIA\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n1\n1\n1\n\n\nNORA\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\n\nHELEN\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n0\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n\n\nOLIVIA\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n\n\nFLORA\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n\n\nPEARL\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\nDOROTHY\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n\nTable 1: Southern Women Data."

In the original paper, Kovacs (2010, p. 206), described these results verbally—no plot was provided—as follows:\n\nThe generalized similarity model provides a grouping for the events as well (not shown here). This grouping differs slightly from Doreian et al.’s grouping: although the (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and (10, 11, 12, 13, 14) clusters emerge in the generalized similarity solution as well, the picture differs for events 6, 7, 8, and 9.

    "section": "",
    "text": "In a previous post I point to a forthcoming chapter where I argue for the intimate link (conceptually and in terms of formalization) between recent work on categories in the organizations literature and the developing line of research on cultural holes in the culture and networks tradition. At the end of the chapter, I noted that one of the areas where cultural holes work can move forward is by incorporating a dynamic or temporal component. The basic cultural holes argument, noting that people’s—or organizations; see Silver et al. (2022)—positions in the socio-cultural structure matter for various outcomes relies essentially on a model of comparative statics.\nHowever, if we consider a person’s portfolio of connections to a set of cultural categories or objects—their “cultural ego network”—at any point in time, it is clear that this cross-sectional outcome is the result of some time-ordered process of adding links. That is, while this information is usually absent in most setups, links in two-mode cultural networks do have a hidden attribute (e.g., “age”). Given this attribute, it is possible to order the links from oldest to youngest."

    "section": "Accounting for time in cultural holes",
    "text": "Accounting for time in cultural holes\nI think that the next step is to develop the cultural holes argument so as to account for this temporal component. This has not been done yet, but I think a useful starting point, is a wonderful paper by Ming Leung published in American Sociological Review in 2014. The basic empirical context of the paper is the freelance work industry. While Leung’s paper is not framed according to the language and concepts of the cultural holes imagery, it is not hard to do the translation.\nConsider a set of freelance workers, each with a job history. At some cross-section, we observe a two-mode network (\\(\\mathbf{A}\\)) of dimensions \\(P \\times J\\) where \\(P\\) is the number of freelancers and \\(J\\) is the number of categorically defined jobs. We can project the jobs into a one-mode network \\(\\mathbf{JJ}\\) using the familiar formula due to Breiger (1974):\n\\[\n     JJ = A^TA\n\\tag{1}\\] As I noted in the previous post, once we have \\(JJ\\), we have the ingredients to compute most measures of similarity between jobs (and by implication distance in some categorical space).\nIn the 2014 paper, Leung computes an asymmetric similarity measure (p. 145) as follows:\n\\[\n     S_{ij} = \\frac{JJ_{ij}}{J{ii}}\n\\tag{2}\\] Where \\(JJ_{ij}\\) is the number of freelancers who do jobs \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) and \\(JJ_{ii}\\) is the number of freelancers who do job \\(i\\).\nThe particular measure of similarity used in the paper is less important than Leung’s core argument. Now consider the standard (non-temporal) cultural holes argument. Here, we would look at the cumulative two-mode network at a given time, and say that freelancers bridge cultural holes to the extent that their “cultural ego network” (where the “alters” are types of jobs) is composed of jobs which are relatively dissimilar to one another. Conversely, freelancers whose cultural ego networks is composed of mostly similar jobs (based on Equation 2) have high “constraint” in this context and don’t bridge cultural holes.\nNow moving to the “audience” (potential employers) side, it could be that employers in this context prefer “focused” identities so that bridging cultural holes is bad. Or it could be like Silver et al. (2022) find, that a moderate amount of bridging is best, or it could be the precise functional form depends on industry, metro-context, and so forth–as Silver et al. (2022) also find.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Two ways of bridging cultural holes: (a) Rennaissance person, (b) Erratic dilettante\n\n\nRegardless, all these arguments boil down to comparative statics, and moreover, ignore the temporal information embedded in the network. By including time, Leung’s argument puts a twist on this standard cultural holes formulation. The basic idea is that, in the empirical context of freelancing, the particular sequence with which links are added, interacts with the pairwise similarity between jobs, so that it matters how you ended up bridging cultural holes in terms of this sequencing.\nFigure 1 provides and example. In the figure, nodes labeled \\(P\\) are people and nodes labeled \\(J\\) are jobs. The number next to each edge indicates the time at which it was added. In the job \\(\\times\\) job alter network, the thickness of the line is proportional to the similarity (“tie strength”) between jobs (the figure assumes a symmetrical measure of distance for simplicity). Note that in the cross-section, these two cultural networks are equivalent. Both are composed of one strong tie, two medium strength ties, and three weak ties.1 So the level of cultural hole bridging, however we measure it, is the same.\nLeung argues that they are not the same. In the case of Figure 1 (a), we can see that when the tie to the second job was added, this job was very similar to the first job. Then the person added a third tie to a job that was moderately similar to the second job and dissimilar from the first job. Then the fourth tie was to a job that was once again moderately similar to the previously held job and dissimilar to the first two jobs. The pairwise similarities between jobs end up being time-ordered so that they are stronger for temporally close jobs and weaker for temporally distant jobs.\nLeung argues that pattern Figure 1 (a) of temporal cultural hole bridging, where dissimilarity is gradually increased over time is more likely to be perceived by employers as typical of a “Renaissance” person. That is, a person who likely has strong capabilities on different types of jobs.\nThis is different from Figure 1 (b). Here we see that ties added in close proximity go to weakly related jobs. Then the last tie goes to a job very similar than the first. So while Figure 1 (b) has as much non-temporal cultural hole bridging as Figure 1 (a) the temporal sequence in which the bridging was done is more likely to be perceived by audiences as that of an “erratic dilettante” unlikely to be good at any of the jobs.\nLeung finds support for these hypotheses (although, once again, he does not frame his paper in terms of the cultural holes argument), showing that indeed “erraticism” (a measured by the cumulative sum of the distances—one minus the similarities—between consecutive jobs for a given person in the temporal two-mode network) has a positive effect on winning a bid until a moderate point, at which the effect is steep and negative: Highly erratic workers are less preferred by employers. So the sequencing via which people bridge cultural holes matters."

    "section": "Conclusion",
    "text": "Conclusion\nWhile developed in the case of jobs and careers in the freelancing industry, recasting Leung’s arguments in terms of temporal cultural hole bridging reveals its broader implications. For instance, Leahey & Moody (2014) show that cultural hole bridging in scientific careers could be good. But, given the previous, it is clear that the order in which scientists “stretch” out by adding specialties may matter. It is likely that a scientist who ends up being perceived as a renaissance person follows pattern Figure 1 (a), so they gradually stretch and temporally order the amount of stretching.\nThe argument could also be used to understand cultural tastes—where the cultural holes argument has only been made in terms of comparative statics (Lizardo, 2014). Accordingly, different patterns of cultural hole bridging are likely to differentiate different types of omnivores based on their life course history and interaction with genres and cultural objects (Lembo, 2017). Bourdieu (1984) for instance, famously argued that you can get (a version of) “omnivorousness” (although he obviously didn’t call it this) by acquiring an aesthetic disposition for the standard cultural goods (the ones that have been legitimated as art by the usual institutions), and then “extending” to the ones that are on their way to legitimation, and then extending to the ones that are less legitimate, and so forth (see Lizardo (2018) for a re-statement of this argument and Childress et al. (2021) for supportive empirical evidence). This is clearly a story that can be formalized as a temporal cultural hole bridging argument applicable to cultural tastes, although very likely not the only one."

    "title": "Two-Mode Relational Similarities Among Impressionist Artists",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Cutting (2006) collected data on impressionist artists from a variety of sources. Three tables are relevant for the following analysis. One compiles a list of impressionist painters by the number of paintings housed in each of twenty two museums known for their impressionist collections. The first seven are “major” museums (e.g., the Met, Art Institute of Chicago, National Gallery in London, and the rest are more regional and specialized). The second lists the first major dealers of impressionist arts in the rows and the number of paintings they should for each artist in the columns. Finally, the third table lists the first major collectors of impressionist art in the rows, by the number of paintings of each artist they collected (in the columns). The data can be found here. You will need the function tm.corr.dist which you can find here.\nOn the first sheet, is the artist by museum data. On the second sheet is the dealer by artist data. On the third sheet is the collector by artist data. In all three two-way tables the cell in each entry \\(x_{ij}\\) is a count. In the first case, the number of paintings from artist i held by the \\(j^{th}\\) museum. In the second case, the number of paintings that dealer i sold from the \\(j^{th}\\) artist. In the third case, the number of paintings from artist j collected by collector i.\nThese are data that are ideal to analyze from the perspective of generalized relational similarity (Kovacs, 2010). Cutting (2006) analyzed the data using multidimensional scaling of the similarities but these were computed using the standard correlation distance. The correlation distance treats pairs of actors as similar if they have similar patterns of object choice. In a generalized relational similarity approach, on the other hand, actors are similar if they have similar patterns of choice with respect to similar objects. This is different from the usual similarity approach used by Cutting (2006) in which actors are similar only if they have similar patterns of choice, but where the similarity of the objects chosen is not taken into account.\nI analyze these data using the two-mode variant of generalized similarity discussed in Lizardo (2024), where the correlation distance is tuned using the similarity in the other mode computed from the one-mode projection using the Breiger (1974) approach. In the museum table, we can think of the museums as the (institutional) “actors” doing the choosing and the impressionist artists as the objects chosen. In the same way, in dealers table, we can think of the dealers as the actors doing the choosing and the impressionist painters (or rather their paintings) as the objects chosen. Finally, in the collectors table, the collectors are the actors and the paintings collected from each artist the objects.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Two Mode Generalized Similarities Among Museums.\n\n\n\n\nAccordingly, artists are similar to the extent that they are chosen by museums with similar patterns of cultural choice. Museums are similar to the extent that they choose similar artists. In the same way, dealers are similar to the extent that they choose similar artists, whereby artists’ similarity is defined by their distribution across dealers (artists chosen by similar dealers are similar). Collectors’ generalized similarities are defined in the same way as the dealers’. Thus, we should expect to see a partitioning of the three sets of actors that reveals something about the wider field they are embedded in. A github repo containing material to reproduce all the analyses and plots can be found here). You can also get all the code needed to reproduce the plots shown below by clicking the “view source” link in the outline menu on the right.\nFigure 1 shows the non-metric multidimensional scaling plot of generalized similarities across museums, clustered into four groups. Each cluster contains one or two of Cutting’s seven “major” museums surrounded by minor satellites, revealing differentiation by region and status. Thus, the upper left is the Orsay cluster–considered the world’s leading impressionist museum–surrounded by three European satellites: Two Danish museums (OrD and NGD) and a Museum in St. Petersburg. The middle right cluster contains two of the world’s leading museums, located in the two cities at the center of the global artworld: The Met in New York City and the National Gallery of Art in London (NGAL). Here, status serves as a glue linking the choices of these two institutions across the Atlantic. These are surrounded by museums in Washington DC (PC), Switzerland (RE and Bu), Pennsylvania (Ba), and a smaller London museums (Co). Continuing clockwise, we find a cluster anchored by the Philadelphia Museum of Art (PMA) and Museum of Fine Arts in Boston (MFAB), surrounded by a Harvard Art Museum (Fo)—in keeping with the regional logic—along with a state museum in Moscow (Pu). Finally, the last cluster is centered on two major “second city” (e.g., relative to New York) museum in the U.S.: The Art Institute of Chicago (AIC) and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. These are surrounded by museums in Pasadena (NS)—again in keeping with the regional logic—along with institutions in Tennessee (Di), and Massachusetts (Cl). Surprisingly, this cluster also features a smaller Parisian museum (Ma).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Two Mode Generalized Similarities Among Dealers.\n\n\n\n\nWhat about the dealers? The two-mode generalized similarities for these actors are shown in Figure 2. The biggest cluster in the upper-left contains four out of the six “major” dealers according to Cutting (2006, pp. 93-95): Durand-Ruel, Petit, Bernheim-June and Rosenberg. These are all except Vollard and Wildenstein who form their own cluster in the lower-left (joined by New-York-based Acquavella), likely united by their voraciousness for Cezanne. The MDS maps of dealers differs systematically from that presented by Cutting (Fig. 6.1, p. 96) based on the simple correlation distance.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Two Mode Generalized Similarities Among Artists (based on dealer’s similarities)\n\n\n\n\nThe map of artists based on dealers tastes shown in Figure 3, also differs from that presented by Cutting (ibid). In Cutting’s plot, Guillaumin, Manet, Monet, Pissarro and Sisley appear packed in the same area of the space, suggesting maximum similarity among these five artists. Taking into account the generalized similarity among dealers who sold their work, we can see that Manet and Monet are most similar, Sisley and Pissarro form their own cluster, and Guillaumin is clearly distinct from these two groups. In Cutting’s plot, Degas and Renoir are similar, but taking into account similarity across dealers show that they are quite distinct along the second dimension, and that Renoir is most similar to Caillebotte, while Degas is most similar to Guillaumin, Gonzales, and Cassatt.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Two Mode Generalized Similarities Among Collectors\n\n\n\n\nWhat about the collectors? The relevant two-mode similarity MDS plot is shown in Figure 4. The plot divides clearly into three clusters. The lower-right hand group includes Faure, Hoschede, Duret, and de Bellio, all four listed by Cutting (2006, p. 98) as the earliest impressionist collectors (early 1870s). They are joined by Tschudi a pioneer collector from Germany and Matsukata another early collector from Japan. The two mode generalized similarities therefore are picking up commonalities in their collecting patterns based on timing (as pioneers of impressionist collecting). The rest of the “first generation” collectors are split into two distinct clusters in the upper portion of the plot. Charpentier, Rouart, and Caillebotte on the right, and Choquet and Gachet on the left. Interesting, the two major early American collectors of this era Clark and Barnes are split across these two different groups, suggesting systematic differences in their patterns of cultural choice.\n\nReferences\nBreiger, R.

    "section": "",
    "text": "In a 2018 piece published in Poetics I adapted an approach to computing “reflective centralities” in two-mode data developed by Hidalgo & Hausmann (2009)—hereafter HH—to generalize basic formal notions in the study of cultural taste. Namely, “omnivorousness” on the side of people and “popularity” on the side of genres. The basic idea is that people can be characterized by the formal properties of the genres they choose (e.g., popularity versus nicheness) and genres can be characterized by the formal properties of the people who choose them (e.g., omnivores versus univores), at various levels of “reflections” (see the paper for more details).\nOf course, the HH reflective approach is not restricted to any type of data—although I would argue there is a particular elective affinity between this formalization and the substantive subject of cultural taste. In fact, it can be considered part of a family of reflective methods to compute the centralities of object in one node set in two-mode networks using relational information from the objects in the other node set.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1:  Southern Women Data. \n \n  \n      \n    E1 \n    E2 \n    E3 \n    E4 \n    E5 \n    E6 \n    E7 \n    E8 \n    E9 \n    E10 \n    E11 \n    E12 \n    E13 \n    E14 \n  \n \n\n  \n    EVELYN \n    1 \n    1 \n    1 \n    1 \n    1 \n    1 \n    0 \n    1 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    LAURA \n    1 \n    1 \n    1 \n    0 \n    1 \n    1 \n    1 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    THERESA \n    0 \n    1 \n    1 \n    1 \n    1 \n    1 \n    1 \n    1 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    BRENDA \n    1 \n    0 \n    1 \n    1 \n    1 \n    1 \n    1 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    CHARLOTTE \n    0 \n    0 \n    1 \n    1 \n    1 \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    FRANCES \n    0 \n    0 \n    1 \n    1 \n    1 \n    1 \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    ELEANOR \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    1 \n    1 \n    1 \n    1 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    RUTH \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    1 \n    1 \n    0 \n    1 \n    1 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    VERNE \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    1 \n    1 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    MYRA \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    1 \n    1 \n    1 \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    KATHERINE \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    1 \n    1 \n    1 \n    0 \n    1 \n    1 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    SYLVIA \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    1 \n    1 \n    1 \n    1 \n    0 \n    1 \n    1 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    NORA \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n    1 \n    1 \n    1 \n    1 \n    1 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    HELEN \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    1 \n    1 \n    0 \n    1 \n    1 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    OLIVIA \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    FLORA \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    PEARL \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n    1 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    DOROTHY \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    1 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n\n\nNote: \n\n Rows ordered according to the generalized blockmodeling solution of Doreian et al.

    "text": "Reflective Centralities of Persons and Groups\nTake the classic case of the duality of persons and groups (Breiger, 1974). At the first level, the most basic measure of centrality is degree centrality. Recall that a two-mode network composed of a set of people \\(P\\) and their affiliation relations to a set of groups \\(P\\) can be represented by an affiliation matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) of dimensions \\(|P| \\times |G|\\) with people along the rows and groups across the columns, where \\(|P|\\) is the cardinality of the people set and \\(|G|\\) is the cardinality of the group set, with cell entries \\(a_{pg}= 1\\) if person p is affiliated with group g and \\(a_{pg}= 0\\) otherwise.\nIn this case, the degree centrality of people is given by:\n\\[\n   C^R_p(1) = \\sum_g a_{pg}\n\\tag{1}\\]\nAnd for groups:\n\\[\n   C^R_g(1) = \\sum_p a_{pg}\n\\tag{2}\\]\nFor instance, for the classic Davis et al. (1941) Southern Women Data shown in Table 1, the centrality of the degree centralities of the people are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEVELYN\nLAURA\nTHERESA\nBRENDA\nCHARLOTTE\nFRANCES\nELEANOR\nRUTH\nVERNE\nMYRA\nKATHERINE\nSYLVIA\nNORA\nHELEN\nOLIVIA\nFLORA\nPEARL\nDOROTHY\n\n\n\n\n8\n7\n8\n7\n4\n5\n5\n5\n4\n4\n6\n7\n7\n5\n2\n2\n3\n2\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd for the groups:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE1\nE2\nE3\nE4\nE5\nE6\nE7\nE8\nE9\nE10\nE11\nE12\nE13\nE14\n\n\n\n\n3\n3\n6\n7\n8\n7\n10\n14\n12\n5\n4\n6\n3\n3\n\n\n\n\n\nThe key to the reflective approach is the observation that, once we have these first-order quantities, it is possible to compute “second order centralities” for both people and groups using the centralities of the other mode.\nFor people, this is:\n\\[\n   C^R_p(2) = \\frac{1}{C^R_p(1)}\\sum_g a_{pg}C^R_g(1)\n\\tag{3}\\]\nAnd for groups:\n\\[\n   C^R_g(2) = \\frac{1}{C^R_g(1)}\\sum_p a_{pg}C^R_p(1)\n\\tag{4}\\]\nEquation 3 says “people are more central when the average membership of the groups they belong to is large” (e.g., \\(a_{pg} = 1\\) and \\(C^R_g(1)\\) is a big number). Equation 4 says “groups are more central when the average number of memberships of their members is large” (e.g., \\(a_{pg} = 1\\) and \\(C^R_p(1)\\) is a big number).\nOf course, we can keep on going and define third-order reflections:\n\\[\n   C^R_p(3) = \\frac{1}{C^R_p(1)}\\sum_g a_{pg}C^R_g(2)\n\\tag{5}\\]\n\\[\n   C^R_g(3) = \\frac{1}{C^R_g(1)}\\sum_p a_{pg}C^R_p(2)\n\\tag{6}\\]\nEquation 5 says something like “people are more central when the average of the average number of memberships of the members of the groups they belong to is large” (e.g., \\(a_{pg} = 1\\) and \\(C^R_g(2)\\) is a big number). Equation 6 says something like “groups are more central when the average of the average number of members of the groups their members belong to is large” (e.g., \\(a_{pg} = 1\\) and \\(C^R_p(2)\\) is a big number).\nNote that for the people, the even-numbered reflection \\(C^R_p(2)\\) assigns centrality based on a formal feature of the groups they belong to (in this case, their degree centrality). On the other hand, the odd-numbered reflection \\(C^R_p(3)\\) assigns centrality based on a formal feature of the members of the groups they belong to.\nIn the same way, for the groups, the even-numbered reflection \\(C^R_g(2)\\) assigns centrality based on a formal feature of the people who belong to them (in this case, their degree centrality). On the other hand, the odd-numbered reflection \\(C^R_g(3)\\) assigns centrality based on a formal feature of the groups their members belong to.\nMore generally, we can define a series of reflective quantities for people and groups (whose verbal interpretation becomes more complex as the number of iterations increases):\n\\[\n   C^R_p(q) = \\frac{1}{C^R_p(1)}\\sum_g a_{pg}C^R_g(q-1)\n\\]\n\\[\n   C^R_g(q) = \\frac{1}{C^R_g(1)}\\sum_p a_{pg}C^R_p(q-1)\n\\tag{7}\\]\nFor all \\(q>1\\) (Hidalgo & Hausmann, 2009). This results in a series of vectors of reflective centrality scores for both people and groups across iterations \\(q =\\{1, 2, 3, ....Q\\}\\), which can be arranged into a \\(P \\times Q\\) matrix (for people) and \\(G \\times Q\\) matrix (for groups).\n\n\nhere() starts at C:/Users/Omar Lizardo/Google Drive/UCLA/mysite\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCr_2\nCr_4\nCr_6\nCr_8\nCr_10\nCr_12\nCr_14\nCr_16\nCr_18\nCr_20\n\n\n\n\nEVELYN\n15.0\n9.0\n7.0\n4.0\n5.0\n5.0\n5.0\n5.0\n5.0\n5.0\n\n\nLAURA\n16.0\n14.0\n10.0\n5.0\n3.0\n3.0\n3.0\n3.0\n3.0\n3.0\n\n\nTHERESA\n8.0\n7.0\n6.0\n7.0\n7.0\n7.0\n7.0\n7.0\n7.0\n7.0\n\n\nBRENDA\n11.0\n10.0\n8.0\n3.0\n4.0\n4.0\n4.0\n4.0\n4.0\n4.0\n\n\nCHARLOTTE\n13.0\n11.0\n9.0\n2.0\n2.0\n2.0\n2.0\n2.0\n2.0\n2.0\n\n\nFRANCES\n7.0\n6.0\n2.0\n1.0\n1.0\n1.0\n1.0\n1.0\n1.0\n1.0\n\n\nELEANOR\n6.0\n5.0\n3.0\n6.0\n6.0\n6.0\n6.0\n6.0\n6.0\n6.0\n\n\nRUTH\n4.0\n3.0\n5.0\n8.0\n8.0\n8.0\n8.0\n8.0\n8.0\n8.0\n\n\nVERNE\n3.0\n4.0\n11.0\n11.0\n11.0\n11.0\n11.0\n11.0\n11.0\n11.0\n\n\nMYRA\n5.0\n8.0\n12.0\n12.0\n13.0\n13.0\n13.0\n13.0\n13.0\n13.0\n\n\nKATHERINE\n17.0\n17.0\n17.0\n17.0\n17.0\n17.0\n17.0\n15.0\n15.0\n15.0\n\n\nSYLVIA\n14.0\n16.0\n16.0\n16.0\n16.0\n14.0\n14.0\n14.0\n14.0\n14.0\n\n\nNORA\n18.0\n18.0\n18.0\n18.0\n18.0\n18.0\n18.0\n18.0\n18.0\n18.0\n\n\nHELEN\n12.0\n15.0\n15.0\n15.0\n12.0\n12.0\n12.0\n12.0\n12.0\n12.0\n\n\nOLIVIA\n9.5\n12.5\n13.5\n13.5\n14.5\n15.5\n15.5\n16.5\n16.5\n16.5\n\n\nFLORA\n9.5\n12.5\n13.5\n13.5\n14.5\n15.5\n15.5\n16.5\n16.5\n16.5\n\n\nPEARL\n2.0\n2.0\n1.0\n9.0\n9.0\n9.0\n9.0\n9.0\n9.0\n9.0\n\n\nDOROTHY\n1.0\n1.0\n4.0\n10.0\n10.0\n10.0\n10.0\n10.0\n10.0\n10.0\n\n\n\nTable 2: Even numbered reflective centralities for people in the Southern Women Data"

Figure 1 and Figure 2 show such charts for the data corresponding to Table 2 and Table 3 respectively.1 As the tables show, in all cases, the rankings “freeze” after a relatively small number of iterations (\\(q \\approx 18\\))\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'cowplot'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:lubridate':\n\n    stamp\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Even numbered reflective centrality trajectories for actors in Southern Women Data.\n\n\n\n\nAs Figure 1 shows, \\(NORA\\), \\(FLORA\\), \\(CHARLOTTE\\), and \\(EVELYN\\) are the top-ranked actors when it comes to \\(C^R_p(2)\\): The average number of members of the groups they belong to. However, their fates in this reflective metric diverge at higher reflections, with \\(NORA\\) and \\(FLORA\\) maintaining their top positions but \\(CHARLOTTE\\) and \\(EVELYN\\) tumbling down the ranks, suggesting that the members of the groups they belong to affiliate with smaller groups than the members of the groups \\(NORA\\) and \\(FLORA\\) belong to (and so on for higher reflections).\nNotably, the reflective centrality ranks at the highest reflection (\\(q = 20\\)) in Table 2, recovers the Doreian et al. (2004) block partition (see Table 1), but this time with Dorothy and Pearl in the middle separating the two largest blocks of women.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Odd numbered reflective centrality trajectories for actors in Southern Women Data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGroups\nFigure 3 and Figure 4 show the corresponding bump charts for the events. Just like for this actors, the equilibrium reflective centralities recover the ordering of the columns according to Doreian et al. generalized blockmodel with events 1-6 separated from events 10-15 by events 7-9 (see also Kovacs, 2010).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Even numbered reflective centrality trajectories for events in Southern Women Data.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3 shows that \\(E14\\) experiences the most dramatic improvement in status as we move to higher reflections. Relatively low ranked when it comes to the average number of memberships of its members, it increases in standing when considering the average of the average number memberships of its members (and so forth).\nThe most dramatic change in status is for \\(E1\\) in Figure 4, which begins as the top event when centrality is measured as the average size of the memberships of its members, but ends up dead last at higher reflections, suggesting that the average size of the events attended by the members of the groups its members belong to are smaller than other events (and so forth).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Odd numbered reflective centrality trajectories for events in Southern Women Data."

Think of them like exercises; they are there to build your network muscles!\nPlease make sure you truly understand a solution, and please: DO NOT COPY SOLUTIONS. We will figure it out. If we discover that some members of a working group have copied solutions, the entire group will be reported to the Dean of Students on the grounds of Academic Misconduct. Even if we don’t catch you, you won’t really understand what you’ve done, and things will not go well when exams roll around. You’ll only be hurting yourself in the long run.\nIf you turn in homework late, without permission or an extraordinarily good excuse (e.g., accompanied by a doctor’s note or irrefutable evidence of a zombie apocalypse), you will lose marks: 2 points out of 10 for each day late. We will not accept homework more than 5 days after the due date, and may impose tighter deadlines for late homework as the need arises.

You can also show drafts of your papers to other students and receive from them editing assistance. However, all written work (papers, posted questions and comments) must be written by the student submitting the work. Any suspected instance of cheating or plagiarism will be dealt with according to the policies of UCLA’s Honor Code. As an undergraduate at the UCLA, you are bound by the University’s academic code of conduct found here.\nWe expect that everyone by now is familiar with it because not knowing the rules is not an excuse; you can violate the conduct without knowing it. So (re) familiarize yourself with it. Of most relevance to the class, is the part of the code of conduct that deals with “Academic Dishonesty.” This term covers a wide range of behaviors and practices, some of which you may think is not such a big deal at all (e.g., copying and pasting a sentence from a Wikipedia article without citation or attribution). Note, however, that academic dishonesty covers much more than that and includes but is not limited to: “cheating, fabrication or falsification, plagiarism, multiple submissions or facilitating academic misconduct which occurs in academic exercises or submissions.”"

    "text": "Participating in Class Discussion\nThere are two ways to participate in the discussion during the seminar.\n\nThe formal side of participation will come in the form of you signing up as a co-discussion leader for three out of our nine meetings after week 1.\nThe informal side will come from you contributing to seminar discussion in the form of questions, comments, and observations regarding the readings assigned for that week.\n\nYou can contribute to the seminar discussion in two ways:\n\nBy asking questions and providing comments during our IRL discussion in class.\nBy submitting questions and comments via the Bruinlearn discussion tool before class.\n\n\nFirst Week Participation\nFor our first week meeting, each of you should submit at least one comment or question on that week’s reading via the general questions and comments discussion tool. These will be the basis of our seminar discussion for that week.\n\n\nDiscussion Leader Process (Weeks Two through Ten)\nThe week you are a discussion leader you will work with your co-discussion leaders to create an analytic memo covering the readings for that week. The memo should go beyond a summary of the readings. Instead you should aim to produce: - A synthetic document, bringing up points of commonality, tensions, contradictions, and prospects for future development. - In addition, the memo will close with a series of discussion questions for us to consider in class. The questions can focus on any aspect of the readings, whether conceptual, substantive, empirical applications, implications, and the like. - The memo will be submitted by noon the day before class (that is Thursday by 5p) in the so that your classmates have a chance to read it, comment on it, and add their own perspective and questions. You will submit it via the discussion leader tool on Bruinlearn, so that we all have a chance to take a look at it before we meet for class discussion."

    "text": "Final Written Assingment\nThe basic goal here is for you to end up with something that could be useful to you at the end of the day. As such, I’ll give you a set of options here, but if you none of these work, we can talk about something that can be customized for your needs and goals.\nThe final written assignment will be due on Friday March 22nd at 11:59p.\nBy the end of the course you should be ready to submit one of the following:\n\nDraft Research Paper\nThis will be a 15-20 page (double-spaced, Times New Roman Font, 12pt, 1in margins) draft of a research paper. This paper will contain some kind of data analysis, involving data on culture broadly defined to include qualitative or quantitative data. It will include an introduction reviewing literature and setting up a research problem or question. It will then move on to a methods section describing your data and analytic approach, and will close with a discussion section summarizing key findings, outlining implications for substantive research and theory, and describing potential future work and extensions. The goal here is to come up with a draft of a paper that could one day be submitted to the various social science and sociology-oriented journal focused on substantive research, whether “generalist” (e.g., American Sociological Review, American Journal of Sociology) or “specialist” (e.g., Poetics, American Journal of Cultural Sociology).\n\n\nDraft Conceptual Paper\nThis will be a 15-20 page (double-spaced, Times New Roman Font, 12pt, 1in margins) draft of a theory paper. The paper will focus on a set of concepts, theoretical ideas, or overall perspectives for approaching the study of social life that are based, inspired, extend, or incorporate ideas, concepts, debates, or perspectives from cultural sociology (broadly defined). The goal here is to come up with a draft of a paper that could one day be submitted to the various social science and sociology-oriented journal focused on “culture” or “theory.”\n\n\nDraft Literature Review\nThis will be a 10 page (double-spaced, Times New Roman Font, 12pt, 1in margins) draft of a literature review of work done from a cultural sociology perspective on a topic of your interest. The paper will cover what has been done in the field so far, what the strengths and limitations of previous is, and will note gaps or opportunities for future work addressing those limitations or extending the literature to new substantive domains, perhaps linking previous work to the some of the stuff we will be reading in class.\n\n\nDraft Research Proposal\nThis will be a 10 page (single-spaced, Times New Roman Font, 12pt, 1in margins) draft of a research proposal for a project incorporating core ideas and concepts from cultural sociology that you plan to start in the near future. The proposal will include a background section reviewing previous work, noting their strengths and limitations, and pointing to gaps in the literature. It will also include an “approach” section describing your research project, your main research questions, the data gathering procedures you will use, and the data-analytic techniques you plan to implement once your data is collected. It will close with an implication sections describing what the contributions of your project will be and why it is relevant and important.\nWhatever you decide, you will submit an extended abstract of your final project, due on week 5 (Sunday 11:59p). This will be a one-page, single-spaced document with 12pt Times New Roman Font and 1in margins. I will provide you with brief feedback and a “green light” on the abstract."
