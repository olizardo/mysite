    "text": "Early Life\nI was born in New York City, spent the better part of the first 17 years of my life in a (then) small coastal city called La Romana (i.e. “The Roman” with feminine inflection) on the Southeast corner of Dominican Republic, and have lived in the U.S. ever since.\n\n\nAcademic Training\nI earned a Bachelor of Science in Psychology from Brooklyn College in 1997. Starting in the year 2000, I enrolled in the graduate program in the Department of Sociology at the University of Arizona, where I was fortunate to earn a Ph.D. in 2006 under the supervision and mentorship of Ron Breiger and Al Bergesen.\n\n\nEarly Academic Career\nStarting in 2006, I had the privilege to spend the first twelve years of my academic career in the Department of Sociology at the University of Notre Dame. I was promoted to Associate Professor with tenure in 2012, and to Full Professor in 2016. While at Notre Dame, I was selected as co-editor, with Rory McVeigh and Sarah Mustillo, of the American Sociological Review, the flagship journal of the American Sociological Association (ASA), for a five-year term starting in 2015. In 2014, received the Lewis Coser Award for Theoretical Agenda Setting from the ASA’s Section on Theory.\n\n\nRecent Academic Career\nIn 2018, I decided to make the transition to the West (best) coast and moved to California, where I am currently a ladder faculty member and LeRoy Neiman Term Chair Professor in the Department of Sociology at UCLA. While at UCLA, I was elected a member of the Sociological Research Association in 2019. In 2020, I was appointed to the Board of Review Editors for the journal Science."

These homework assignments will give you an opportunity to use the concepts and techniques from the course to analyze various social systems, as well as testing your understanding of basic definitions and procedures. Think of them like exercises; they are there to build your network muscles!\nPlease make sure you truly understand a solution, and please: DO NOT COPY SOLUTIONS. We will figure it out. If we discover that some members of a working group have copied solutions, the entire group will be reported to the Dean of Students on the grounds of Academic Misconduct. Even if we don’t catch you, you won’t really understand what you’ve done, and things will not go well when exams roll around. You’ll only be hurting yourself in the long run.\nIf you turn in homework late, without permission or an extraordinarily good excuse (e.g., accompanied by a doctor’s note or irrefutable evidence of a zombie apocalypse), you will lose marks: 2 points out of 10 for each day late. We will not accept homework more than 5 days after the due date, and may impose tighter deadlines for late homework as the need arises. When submitting an assignment, please be sure that you have the final version you intend to upload for grading."

We strongly encourage you to make visits to the Bruinlearn site as a regular part of your preparation for this course.\nE-mail should be used for quick communications (things that can be responded to in no more than a few sentences); use office hours for anything requiring more in-depth discussion. Please consider email as subject to the same standards of communication as you would all other forms of written material in this course (i.e., you should use complete sentences, proper punctuation, etc.). We will typically respond to email within two work days.\nIf you have a small question or a clarification question, please email your TA about it first. If the TA does not have the answer, then email me.\nWe will not, under any circumstances discuss grades over email. Use an office hour appointment to discuss grade issues with me.\nOffice Hours are available to add to your experience in this course. Please make use of them. Each of us has specific office hours each week.

    "text": "Academic Code of Conduct\nStudents are strongly encouraged to discuss ideas for papers and assignments with other students. You can also show drafts of your papers to other students and receive from them editing assistance. However, all written work (papers, posted questions and comments) must be written by the student submitting the work. Any suspected instance of cheating or plagiarism will be dealt with according to the policies of UCLA’s Honor Code. As an undergraduate at the UCLA, you are bound by the University’s academic code of conduct found here.\nWe expect that everyone by now is familiar with it because not knowing the rules is not an excuse; you can violate the conduct without knowing it. So (re) familiarize yourself with it. Of most relevance to the class, is the part of the code of conduct that deals with “Academic Dishonesty.” This term covers a wide range of behaviors and practices, some of which you may think is not such a big deal at all (e.g., copying and pasting a sentence from a Wikipedia article without citation or attribution). Note, however, that academic dishonesty covers much more than that and includes but is not limited to: “cheating, fabrication or falsification, plagiarism, multiple submissions or facilitating academic misconduct which occurs in academic exercises or submissions.”"

These will be the basis of our seminar discussion for that week.\n\n\nDiscussion Leader Process (Weeks Two through Ten)\nThe week you are a discussion leader you will work with your co-discussion leaders to create an analytic memo covering the readings for that week. The memo should go beyond a summary of the readings. Instead you should aim to produce: - A synthetic document, bringing up points of commonality, tensions, contradictions, and prospects for future development. - In addition, the memo will close with a series of discussion questions for us to consider in class. The questions can focus on any aspect of the readings, whether conceptual, substantive, empirical applications, implications, and the like. - The memo will be submitted by noon the day before class (that is Thursday by 5p) in the so that your classmates have a chance to read it, comment on it, and add their own perspective and questions. You will submit it via the discussion leader tool on Bruinlearn, so that we all have a chance to take a look at it before we meet for class discussion."

    "text": "Final Written Assingment\nThe basic goal here is for you to end up with something that could be useful to you at the end of the day. As such, I’ll give you a set of options here, but if you none of these work, we can talk about something that can be customized for your needs and goals.\nThe final written assignment will be due on Friday March 22nd at 11:59p.\nBy the end of the course you should be ready to submit one of the following:\n\nDraft Research Paper\nThis will be a 15-20 page (double-spaced, Times New Roman Font, 12pt, 1in margins) draft of a research paper. This paper will contain some kind of data analysis, involving data on culture broadly defined to include qualitative or quantitative data. It will include an introduction reviewing literature and setting up a research problem or question. It will then move on to a methods section describing your data and analytic approach, and will close with a discussion section summarizing key findings, outlining implications for substantive research and theory, and describing potential future work and extensions. The goal here is to come up with a draft of a paper that could one day be submitted to the various social science and sociology-oriented journal focused on substantive research, whether “generalist” (e.g., American Sociological Review, American Journal of Sociology) or “specialist” (e.g., Poetics, American Journal of Cultural Sociology).\n\n\nDraft Conceptual Paper\nThis will be a 15-20 page (double-spaced, Times New Roman Font, 12pt, 1in margins) draft of a theory paper. The paper will focus on a set of concepts, theoretical ideas, or overall perspectives for approaching the study of social life that are based, inspired, extend, or incorporate ideas, concepts, debates, or perspectives from cultural sociology (broadly defined). The goal here is to come up with a draft of a paper that could one day be submitted to the various social science and sociology-oriented journal focused on “culture” or “theory.”\n\n\nDraft Literature Review\nThis will be a 10 page (double-spaced, Times New Roman Font, 12pt, 1in margins) draft of a literature review of work done from a cultural sociology perspective on a topic of your interest. The paper will cover what has been done in the field so far, what the strengths and limitations of previous is, and will note gaps or opportunities for future work addressing those limitations or extending the literature to new substantive domains, perhaps linking previous work to the some of the stuff we will be reading in class.\n\n\nDraft Research Proposal\nThis will be a 10 page (single-spaced, Times New Roman Font, 12pt, 1in margins) draft of a research proposal for a project incorporating core ideas and concepts from cultural sociology that you plan to start in the near future. The proposal will include a background section reviewing previous work, noting their strengths and limitations, and pointing to gaps in the literature. It will also include an “approach” section describing your research project, your main research questions, the data gathering procedures you will use, and the data-analytic techniques you plan to implement once your data is collected. It will close with an implication sections describing what the contributions of your project will be and why it is relevant and important.\nWhatever you decide, you will submit an extended abstract of your final project, due on week 5 (Sunday 11:59p). This will be a one-page, single-spaced document with 12pt Times New Roman Font and 1in margins. I will provide you with brief feedback and a “green light” on the abstract."
