    "text": "Early Life\nI was born in New York City, spent the better part of the first 17 years of my life in a (then) small coastal city called La Romana (i.e. “The Roman” with feminine inflection) on the Southeast corner of Dominican Republic, and have lived in the U.S. ever since.\n\n\nAcademic Training\nI earned a Bachelor of Science in Psychology from Brooklyn College in 1997. Starting in the year 2000, I enrolled in the graduate program in the Department of Sociology at the University of Arizona, where I was fortunate to earn a Ph.D. in 2006 under the supervision and mentorship of Ron Breiger and Al Bergesen.\n\n\nEarly Academic Career\nStarting in 2006, I had the privilege to spend the first twelve years of my academic career in the Department of Sociology at the University of Notre Dame. I was promoted to Associate Professor with tenure in 2012, and to Full Professor in 2016. While at Notre Dame, I was selected as co-editor, with Rory McVeigh and Sarah Mustillo, of the American Sociological Review, the flagship journal of the American Sociological Association (ASA), for a five-year term starting in 2015. In 2014, received the Lewis Coser Award for Theoretical Agenda Setting from the ASA’s Section on Theory.\n\n\nRecent Academic Career\nIn 2018, I decided to make the transition to the West (best) coast and moved to California, where I am currently a ladder faculty member and LeRoy Neiman Term Chair Professor in the Department of Sociology at UCLA. While at UCLA, I was elected a member of the Sociological Research Association in 2019. In 2020, I was appointed to the Board of Review Editors for the journal Science."

    "text": "In a forthcoming chapter on the subject of “culture and networks” for the second edition of the Sage Handbook of Social Network Analysis (edited by Peter J. Carrington, John McLevey, and John Scott)—see here for an uncorrected draft—I argue that there intimate links between recent work on cultural networks, duality, and cultural holes, and recent work in the categories literature dealing with fuzziness of categorization, atypicality, and variety in cultural choices.\nThis conceptual linkage is one that was initially noted and developed by Balazs Kocavs in a couple of papers (see here and here) in the early 2010s, but which has not been pursued or developed of late. This is despite the fact that work on categories pursues relentless mathematical formalization, but in a language and style that either obscure or do not make very intuitive its link to formal approaches in the cultural networks tradition based on the ideas of duality and two-mode network analysis (Mützel & Breiger, 2020).\nIn the chapter I argue that particularly that the various conceptual distinctions and measures proposed in Goldberg et al.’s 2016 paper on category atypiticaly, variety, and cultural boundary spanning can be given a familiar representation using tools from the analysis of cultural networks. The argument in the chapter is mostly informal. The purpose of this post is to provide a more formal treatment and extension of some of the ideas discussed in the chapter."

    "text": "The Label Space and Atypicality\nIt is easy to see that the main concepts developed by Goldberg et al. in the 2016 ASR paper (and previously Hannan and Kovacs in a 2015 Sociological Science piece) have ready-made representations in terms of two-mode network metrics.\nTake for, instance, the idea that the category structure of a domain can be captured by “geometrically” representing the cultural space (as defined by the labels). This requires coming up with a criterion for defining interlabel distances, which are themselves based on some criterion for interlabel similarity.\nIn terms of two-mode network analysis, this boils down to taking the one mode projection of the (\\(\\mathbf{B}\\)) matrix:\n\\[\n     LL = B^TB\n\\tag{1}\\]\nThe square matrix \\(\\mathbf{LL}\\) contains the number of objects shared by each pair of labels \\((i,j)\\) in the off-diagonals, and the number of objects covered by each label in the diagonals. The Jaccard (J) similarity measure proposed by Goldberg et al. (eq. 1) is a function of these quantities, and thus can be written as:\n\\[     \n     J_{ij} = \\frac{LL_{ij}}{LL_{ii} + L_{jj} - LL_{ij}}\n\\tag{2}\\]\nBut of course, so are many other measures of similarity, such as cosine, Dice, min-overlap, max-overlap, and the like. All can be defined from quantities obtained from the one-mode label \\(\\times\\) label network obtained from the projection of the original object \\(\\times\\) label network.\nOnce we have a measure of similarity, inter-label distances are obtained by some transformation of label similarities, such that similar objects are close and dissimilar objects are far (Goldberg et al. use a negative exponential function due to Shepard). Distances, in this sense, are derivative of quantities obtained from the one-mode network projection."

Conversely typical objects are those that are assigned similar (close) labels.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Cultural ego networks of typical and atypical objects.\n\n\nThus, if we think of each object as having an “object ego-network” (see #fig-typ) where the “alters” are the labels assigned to it, the typicality/atypicality is purely a function of the weighted density of the alter-alter network surrounding ego, where the weight of the tie between alters is given by the label similarities (or distances). So, when the weights are similarities, typical objects have high “constraint” in their cultural ego network—in Burt’s sense as defined by Lizardo (2014)—with their label alters strongly linked to one another. Atypical objects, on the other hand have low constraint, with their label alters weakly tied to one another. So this is another way of saying that atypical objects span cultural holes in the interlabel network (see Figure 1)."

That’s exactly what Goldberg et al. do, but they don’t characterize it quite that way.\nSo, people’s taste for variety is just the average atypicality of the objects they choose, suitably weighted by their rating of the object if such information is available (see Goldberg et al. eq. 7), such that only objects for which the person displays a positive (after sampling) evaluation count."

    "text": "The Object Space and Variety\nThe same approach, of course, can be used to construct an object \\(\\times\\) object network either from the \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) or \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) networks to define people’s taste for variety. Basically, the idea is that variety seeking can be measured using information on “the average distance of the objects consumed [by people] and that variety seeking means liking pairs of objects that stand far apart in the cultural space” (Goldberg et al. 2016, p. 224).\nHere Goldberg et al. get into some over-complication territory, since they insist on using “cultural space” information to define the inter-object similarities (distances). But then get hung up on the fact that sometimes the label set sizes of different objects are not the same (in our terms, objects cultural ego network sizes are different), and they want to compare distances across sets of different sizes and so forth to define inter-object distances.\nOddly, they ignore the lowest hanging fruit to defining inter-object similarities (and by implication distances). Had they been more attuned to the principle of duality they would have realized they actually had two choices:\n\\[     \n     OO_1 = A^TA\n\\tag{3}\\]\n\\[\n     OO_2 = BB^T\n\\tag{4}\\]\nMatrix \\(OO_1\\) would contain the basic quantities to compute inter-object similarities based on audience overlap. Matrix \\(OO_2\\) would contain the basic quantities to compute inter-object similarities based on inter-label overlap. The first approach is the one pursued by Lizardo (2014) for cultural object genre labels. Goldberg et al. use label distance information to define the inter-object similarity (distance) network, which is fine, so they opt for a complicated version of the projection approach, based on set theoretic distance measures between the label sets assigned to each pair of objects that account for different sizes across the pairs of sets being compared.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Varieties of monism.\n\n\nA more straightforward approach based on duality—like that pursued by Kovacs (2010) in other work—would have just said that objects are (similar) distant in cultural space to the extent they get assigned overlapping (different) labels. Any of the similarity measures (Jaccard, cosine, Dice) applied pairwise to the cells of the \\(OO_2\\) matrix would have yielded that information in a more intuitive way that Goldberg et al’s “modified Hausdorff distance” (Goldberg et al., eqs. 8-9) approach."

    "text": "The Taste for Variety\nIn any case, once an interobject similarity (distance) network is obtained (preferably by the simpler duality approach), then we can loop back to the people and define their taste for variety similarly to how atypicality is defined for objects (this is what Goldberg et al. ultimately end up doing too).\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Strong poly-purism.\n\n\nPeople who seek variety have a cultural ego-network surrounded by objects who are themselves dissimilar (get assigned non-overlapping labels); people who don’t seek variety consume objects who get assigned overlapping labels. Thus, people bridge cultural holes in the variety sense, when they consume categorically distinct pairs of objects.\nUltimately, we can see why Goldberg et al.’s approach yields empirically and analytically distinct measures of boundary spanning based on atypicality-seeking and variety-seeking. In the atypicality case, even an “univore” can cross cultural boundaries, by consuming a single atypical object, like riot grrrl jazz (mono-mixer). In the same way an expansive “omnivore” in terms of volume of choices can fail to span boundaries, by consuming many categorically indistinct objects. Of course, both strategies can be combined yielding a second way to span boundaries, consuming many atypical objects (poly-mixer); finally, a person can like variety while abhorring atypicality yielding yet a third way of crossing boundaries (poly-purist).\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Weak poly-purism.\n\n\nWe can represent these distinct consumer types using the proposed three-mode network imagery. For instance, the different types of “mono” consumers (people with a relatively low taste for variety) are shown in Figure 2. The “mono-mixer” (Figure 2 (a)) is a person who chooses one, albeit highly atypical, genre as given by the low similarity between the labels assigned to it. So while they connect to only a single object, they indirectly connect to multiple (weakly related) labels via that object.\nThe mono-purist comes in two flavors (only implicitly distinguished in Goldberg et al.). The first (Figure 2 (b)) is the “purest” mono-purist: A person who chooses objects most representative of their types (single-labeled objects). Then there is a relatively weaker form of mono-purism: Picking a multi-labeled object whose labels are strongly related to one another (Figure 2 (c)).\nThe same approach can be used to distinguish between different forms of poly-purism. First, there is the strong poly-purist (Figure 3), who only consumes (and likes) objects that are the strongest representatives of their categories, as given by their single label assignment, and the relative dissimilarities between labels across objects consumed. Then there is a weaker form of poly-purism (Figure 4); a consumer who would countenance multi-labeled objects, as long as they are still typical members of their categories, as given by the strong similarities between the labels assigned, and the relative dissimilarities across label sets between objects (a similar approach could be used to define strong and weak varieties of poly-mixing)."

That is, actors should receive more similarity ``points’’ if they connect to objects that are themselves similar. It thus fails to respect the principle of equivalence."

To this end, consider a matrix \\(\\mathbf{S(O)}\\) with cell entries \\(s(o)_{ij}\\) capturing pairwise similarities between the objects in the two-mode network. In this case, a generalized relational similarity (GRS) measure for actors based on the correlation distance can be expressed as:\n\\[\n   D(A)^{grs}_{i,j} =\n    \\frac{\n    (M_{i\\bullet} - \\bar{M_{i\\bullet}})\n    \\mathbf{S(O)}\n    (M_{j\\bullet} - \\bar{M_{j\\bullet}})^T\n    }\n    {\n    \\sqrt{\n    (M_{i\\bullet} - \\bar{M_{i\\bullet}})\n    \\mathbf{S(O)}\n    (M_{i\\bullet} - \\bar{M_{i\\bullet}})^T\n    }\n    \\sqrt{\n    (M_{j\\bullet} - \\bar{M_{j\\bullet}})\n    \\mathbf{S(O)}\n    (M_{j\\bullet} - \\bar{M_{j\\bullet}})^T\n        }\n    }\n\\tag{2}\\]\nKovacs notes that if we have access to an analogous matrix of similarities between actors \\(\\mathbf{S(A)}\\) in the network, then we would be able to also calculate a generalized relational similarity score for objects \\(D(O)^{grs}\\) by plugging in that matrix and the column profiles and means into equation Equation 2, yielding:\n\\[\n   D(O)^{grs}_{i,j} =\n    \\frac{\n    (M_{\\bullet i} - \\bar{M_{\\bullet i}})\n    \\mathbf{S(A)}\n    (M_{\\bullet i} - \\bar{M_{\\bullet i}})^T\n    }\n    {\n    \\sqrt{\n    (M_{\\bullet i} - \\bar{M_{\\bullet i}})\n    \\mathbf{S(A)}\n    (M_{\\bullet i} - \\bar{M_{\\bullet i}})^T\n    }\n    \\sqrt{\n    (M_{\\bullet j} - \\bar{M_{\\bullet j}})\n    \\mathbf{S(A)}\n    (M_{\\bullet j} - \\bar{M_{\\bullet j}})^T\n        }\n    }\n\\tag{3}\\]\nTypically, people only have access to the network information and not exogenous indication of pre-existing similarities between actors or objects, required to compute Equation 2, and Equation 3. Kovacs’s (ingenious) solution is to use the duality property and compute “reflective similarities” by obtaining initial object similarities plugging \\(D(A)^{cor}\\) into Equation 3, equivalent to substituting the identity matrix, of dimensions \\(O \\times O\\), into the slot occupied by \\(\\mathbf{S(O)}\\) in Equation 2. Then, in a second step, using the resulting actor similarities to compute generalized object similarities. This is done by substituting an \\(A \\times A\\) matrix of \\(D(A)^{grs}\\) values obtained in the first step into the slot occupied by \\(\\mathbf{S(A)}\\) in Equation 3. The iterations continue until both \\(D(A)^{grs}\\) and \\(D(A)^{grs}\\) “freeze” according to some stopping criterion (\\(\\epsilon\\)).\nIt is easy to see that Equation 2 and Equation 3 both respect the principle of equivalence. Actors count as similar to the extent they connect to similar objects (\\(\\mathbf{S(O)\\)). Conversely, objects count as similar to the extent they are chosen by similar actors ($ \\mathbf{S(A)$).\nBecause the similarities are defined according to the dual projection method, in which the similarity of actors is based on the objects they choose, and the similarity of objects is based on the actors who choose them, Equation 2 and Equation 3 also respect the principle of duality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE1\nE2\nE3\nE4\nE5\nE6\nE7\nE8\nE9\nE10\nE11\nE12\nE13\nE14\n\n\n\n\nEVELYN\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\nLAURA\n1\n1\n1\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\nTHERESA\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\nBRENDA\n1\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\nCHARLOTTE\n0\n0\n1\n1\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\nFRANCES\n0\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\nELEANOR\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\nRUTH\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n0\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\nVERNE\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n\n\nMYRA\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n\n\nKATHERINE\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n1\n0\n1\n1\n1\n\n\nSYLVIA\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n1\n1\n1\n\n\nNORA\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\n\nHELEN\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n0\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n\n\nOLIVIA\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n\n\nFLORA\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n\n\nPEARL\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\nDOROTHY\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n\nTable 1: Southern Women Data."

Figure 1 is the result of a multidimensional scaling solution of the equilibrium similarities, with actors projected to the space formed by the first two-dimensions, computed using the function cmdscale from the package stats in R version 4.2.2.1\nAs Kovacs noted in the original paper, the distribution of points in the two-dimensional metric MDS space obtained using the generalized relational similarities corresponds to the generalized blockmodeling solution reported by Doreian et al. (2004, Table 4), with two large sets of similar actors separated from one another and from the more peripheral Dorothy and Pearl.\nFigure 2 reports the corresponding analysis for the object (events) relational similarities. In the original paper, Kovacs (2010, p. 206), described these results verbally—no plot was provided—as follows:\n\nThe generalized similarity model provides a grouping for the events as well (not shown here). This grouping differs slightly from Doreian et al.’s grouping: although the (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and (10, 11, 12, 13, 14) clusters emerge in the generalized similarity solution as well, the picture differs for events 6, 7, 8, and 9.

    "section": "",
    "text": "In a previous post I point to a forthcoming chapter where I argue for the intimate link (conceptually and in terms of formalization) between recent work on categories in the organizations literature and the developing line of research on cultural holes in the culture and networks tradition. At the end of the chapter, I noted that one of the areas where cultural holes work can move forward is by incorporating a dynamic or temporal component. The basic cultural holes argument, noting that people’s—or organizations; see Silver et al. (2022)—positions in the socio-cultural structure matter for various outcomes relies essentially on a model of comparative statics.\nHowever, if we consider a person’s portfolio of connections to a set of cultural categories or objects—their “cultural ego network”—at any point in time, it is clear that this cross-sectional outcome is the result of some time-ordered process of adding links. That is, while this information is usually absent in most setups, links in two-mode cultural networks do have a hidden attribute (e.g., “age”). Given this attribute, it is possible to order the links from oldest to youngest."

    "section": "Accounting for time in cultural holes",
    "text": "Accounting for time in cultural holes\nI think that the next step is to develop the cultural holes argument so as to account for this temporal component. This has not been done yet, but I think a useful starting point, is a wonderful paper by Ming Leung published in American Sociological Review in 2014. The basic empirical context of the paper is the freelance work industry. While Leung’s paper is not framed according to the language and concepts of the cultural holes imagery, it is not hard to do the translation.\nConsider a set of freelance workers, each with a job history. At some cross-section, we observe a two-mode network (\\(\\mathbf{A}\\)) of dimensions \\(P \\times J\\) where \\(P\\) is the number of freelancers and \\(J\\) is the number of categorically defined jobs. We can project the jobs into a one-mode network \\(\\mathbf{JJ}\\) using the familiar formula due to Breiger (1974):\n\\[\n     JJ = A^TA\n\\tag{1}\\] As I noted in the previous post, once we have \\(JJ\\), we have the ingredients to compute most measures of similarity between jobs (and by implication distance in some categorical space).\nIn the 2014 paper, Leung computes an asymmetric similarity measure (p. 145) as follows:\n\\[\n     S_{ij} = \\frac{JJ_{ij}}{J{ii}}\n\\tag{2}\\] Where \\(JJ_{ij}\\) is the number of freelancers who do jobs \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) and \\(JJ_{ii}\\) is the number of freelancers who do job \\(i\\).\nThe particular measure of similarity used in the paper is less important than Leung’s core argument. Now consider the standard (non-temporal) cultural holes argument. Here, we would look at the cumulative two-mode network at a given time, and say that freelancers bridge cultural holes to the extent that their “cultural ego network” (where the “alters” are types of jobs) is composed of jobs which are relatively dissimilar to one another. Conversely, freelancers whose cultural ego networks is composed of mostly similar jobs (based on Equation 2) have high “constraint” in this context and don’t bridge cultural holes.\nNow moving to the “audience” (potential employers) side, it could be that employers in this context prefer “focused” identities so that bridging cultural holes is bad. Or it could be like Silver et al. (2022) find, that a moderate amount of bridging is best, or it could be the precise functional form depends on industry, metro-context, and so forth–as Silver et al. (2022) also find.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Two ways of bridging cultural holes: (a) Rennaissance person, (b) Erratic dilettante\n\n\nRegardless, all these arguments boil down to comparative statics, and moreover, ignore the temporal information embedded in the network. By including time, Leung’s argument puts a twist on this standard cultural holes formulation. The basic idea is that, in the empirical context of freelancing, the particular sequence with which links are added, interacts with the pairwise similarity between jobs, so that it matters how you ended up bridging cultural holes in terms of this sequencing.\nFigure 1 provides and example. In the figure, nodes labeled \\(P\\) are people and nodes labeled \\(J\\) are jobs. The number next to each edge indicates the time at which it was added. In the job \\(\\times\\) job alter network, the thickness of the line is proportional to the similarity (“tie strength”) between jobs (the figure assumes a symmetrical measure of distance for simplicity). Note that in the cross-section, these two cultural networks are equivalent. Both are composed of one strong tie, two medium strength ties, and three weak ties.1 So the level of cultural hole bridging, however we measure it, is the same.\nLeung argues that they are not the same. In the case of Figure 1 (a), we can see that when the tie to the second job was added, this job was very similar to the first job. Then the person added a third tie to a job that was moderately similar to the second job and dissimilar from the first job. Then the fourth tie was to a job that was once again moderately similar to the previously held job and dissimilar to the first two jobs. The pairwise similarities between jobs end up being time-ordered so that they are stronger for temporally close jobs and weaker for temporally distant jobs.\nLeung argues that pattern Figure 1 (a) of temporal cultural hole bridging, where dissimilarity is gradually increased over time is more likely to be perceived by employers as typical of a “Renaissance” person. That is, a person who likely has strong capabilities on different types of jobs.\nThis is different from Figure 1 (b). Here we see that ties added in close proximity go to weakly related jobs. Then the last tie goes to a job very similar than the first. So while Figure 1 (b) has as much non-temporal cultural hole bridging as Figure 1 (a) the temporal sequence in which the bridging was done is more likely to be perceived by audiences as that of an “erratic dilettante” unlikely to be good at any of the jobs.\nLeung finds support for these hypotheses (although, once again, he does not frame his paper in terms of the cultural holes argument), showing that indeed “erraticism” (a measured by the cumulative sum of the distances—one minus the similarities—between consecutive jobs for a given person in the temporal two-mode network) has a positive effect on winning a bid until a moderate point, at which the effect is steep and negative: Highly erratic workers are less preferred by employers. So the sequencing via which people bridge cultural holes matters."

    "section": "Conclusion",
    "text": "Conclusion\nWhile developed in the case of jobs and careers in the freelancing industry, recasting Leung’s arguments in terms of temporal cultural hole bridging reveals its broader implications. For instance, Leahey & Moody (2014) show that cultural hole bridging in scientific careers could be good. But, given the previous, it is clear that the order in which scientists “stretch” out by adding specialties may matter. It is likely that a scientist who ends up being perceived as a renaissance person follows pattern Figure 1 (a), so they gradually stretch and temporally order the amount of stretching.\nThe argument could also be used to understand cultural tastes—where the cultural holes argument has only been made in terms of comparative statics (Lizardo, 2014). Accordingly, different patterns of cultural hole bridging are likely to differentiate different types of omnivores based on their life course history and interaction with genres and cultural objects (Lembo, 2017). Bourdieu (1984) for instance, famously argued that you can get (a version of) “omnivorousness” (although he obviously didn’t call it this) by acquiring an aesthetic disposition for the standard cultural goods (the ones that have been legitimated as art by the usual institutions), and then “extending” to the ones that are on their way to legitimation, and then extending to the ones that are less legitimate, and so forth (see Lizardo (2018) for a re-statement of this argument and Childress et al. (2021) for supportive empirical evidence). This is clearly a story that can be formalized as a temporal cultural hole bridging argument applicable to cultural tastes, although very likely not the only one."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Cutting (2006) collected data on impressionist artists from a variety of sources. Three tables are relevant for the following analysis. One compiles a list of impressionist painters by the number of paintings housed in each of twenty two museums known for their impressionist collections. The first seven are “major” museums (e.g., the Met, Art Institute of Chicago, National Gallery in London, and the rest are more regional and specialized). The second lists the first major dealers of impressionist arts in the rows and the number of paintings they should for each artist in the columns. Finally, the third table lists the first major collectors of impressionist art in the rows, by the number of paintings of each artist they collected (in the columns). The data can be found here. You will need the function tm.corr.dist which you can find here.\nOn the first sheet, is the artist by museum data. On the second sheet is the dealer by artist data. On the third sheet is the collector by artist data. In all three two-way tables the cell in each entry \\(x_{ij}\\) is a count. In the first case, the number of paintings from artist i held by the \\(j^{th}\\) museum. In the second case, the number of paintings that dealer i sold from the \\(j^{th}\\) artist. In the third case, the number of paintings from artist j collected by collector i.\nThese are data that are ideal to analyze from the perspective of generalized relational similarity (Kovacs, 2010). Cutting (2006) analyzed the data using multidimensional scaling of the similarities but these were computed using the standard correlation distance. The correlation distance treats pairs of actors as similar if they have similar patterns of object choice. In a generalized relational similarity approach, on the other hand, actors are similar if they have similar patterns of choice with respect to similar objects. This is different from the usual similarity approach used by Cutting (2006) in which actors are similar only if they have similar patterns of choice, but where the similarity of the objects chosen is not taken into account.\nI analyze these data using the two-mode variant of generalized similarity discussed in Lizardo (2024), where the correlation distance is tuned using the similarity in the other mode computed from the one-mode projection using the Breiger (1974) approach. In the museum table, we can think of the museums as the (institutional) “actors” doing the choosing and the impressionist artists as the objects chosen. In the same way, in dealers table, we can think of the dealers as the actors doing the choosing and the impressionist painters (or rather their paintings) as the objects chosen. Finally, in the collectors table, the collectors are the actors and the paintings collected from each artist the objects.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Two Mode Generalized Similarities Among Museums.\n\n\n\n\nAccordingly, artists are similar to the extent that they are chosen by museums with similar patterns of cultural choice. Museums are similar to the extent that they choose similar artists. In the same way, dealers are similar to the extent that they choose similar artists, whereby artists’ similarity is defined by their distribution across dealers (artists chosen by similar dealers are similar). Collectors’ generalized similarities are defined in the same way as the dealers’. Thus, we should expect to see a partitioning of the three sets of actors that reveals something about the wider field they are embedded in. A github repo containing material to reproduce all the analyses and plots can be found here). You can also get all the code needed to reproduce the plots shown below by clicking the “view source” link in the outline menu on the right.\nFigure 1 shows the non-metric multidimensional scaling plot of generalized similarities across museums, clustered into four groups. Each cluster contains one or two of Cutting’s seven “major” museums surrounded by minor satellites, revealing differentiation by region and status. Thus, the upper left is the Orsay cluster–considered the world’s leading impressionist museum–surrounded by three European satellites: Two Danish museums (OrD and NGD) and a Museum in St. Petersburg. The middle right cluster contains two of the world’s leading museums, located in the two cities at the center of the global artworld: The Met in New York City and the National Gallery of Art in London (NGAL). Here, status serves as a glue linking the choices of these two institutions across the Atlantic. These are surrounded by museums in Washington DC (PC), Switzerland (RE and Bu), Pennsylvania (Ba), and a smaller London museums (Co). Continuing clockwise, we find a cluster anchored by the Philadelphia Museum of Art (PMA) and Museum of Fine Arts in Boston (MFAB), surrounded by a Harvard Art Museum (Fo)—in keeping with the regional logic—along with a state museum in Moscow (Pu). Finally, the last cluster is centered on two major “second city” (e.g., relative to New York) museum in the U.S.: The Art Institute of Chicago (AIC) and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. These are surrounded by museums in Pasadena (NS)—again in keeping with the regional logic—along with institutions in Tennessee (Di), and Massachusetts (Cl). Surprisingly, this cluster also features a smaller Parisian museum (Ma).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Two Mode Generalized Similarities Among Dealers.\n\n\n\n\nWhat about the dealers? The two-mode generalized similarities for these actors are shown in Figure 2. The biggest cluster in the upper-left contains four out of the six “major” dealers according to Cutting (2006, pp. 93-95): Durand-Ruel, Petit, Bernheim-June and Rosenberg. These are all except Vollard and Wildenstein who form their own cluster in the lower-left (joined by New-York-based Acquavella), likely united by their voraciousness for Cezanne. The MDS maps of dealers differs systematically from that presented by Cutting (Fig. 6.1, p. 96) based on the simple correlation distance.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Two Mode Generalized Similarities Among Artists (based on dealer’s similarities)\n\n\n\n\nThe map of artists based on dealers tastes shown in Figure 3, also differs from that presented by Cutting (ibid). In Cutting’s plot, Guillaumin, Manet, Monet, Pissarro and Sisley appear packed in the same area of the space, suggesting maximum similarity among these five artists. Taking into account the generalized similarity among dealers who sold their work, we can see that Manet and Monet are most similar, Sisley and Pissarro form their own cluster, and Guillaumin is clearly distinct from these two groups. In Cutting’s plot, Degas and Renoir are similar, but taking into account similarity across dealers show that they are quite distinct along the second dimension, and that Renoir is most similar to Caillebotte, while Degas is most similar to Guillaumin, Gonzales, and Cassatt.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Two Mode Generalized Similarities Among Collectors\n\n\n\n\nWhat about the collectors? The relevant two-mode similarity MDS plot is shown in Figure 4. The plot divides clearly into three clusters. The lower-right hand group includes Faure, Hoschede, Duret, and de Bellio, all four listed by Cutting (2006, p. 98) as the earliest impressionist collectors (early 1870s). They are joined by Tschudi a pioneer collector from Germany and Matsukata another early collector from Japan. The two mode generalized similarities therefore are picking up commonalities in their collecting patterns based on timing (as pioneers of impressionist collecting). The rest of the “first generation” collectors are split into two distinct clusters in the upper portion of the plot. Charpentier, Rouart, and Caillebotte on the right, and Choquet and Gachet on the left. Interesting, the two major early American collectors of this era Clark and Barnes are split across these two different groups, suggesting systematic differences in their patterns of cultural choice.\n\nReferences\nBreiger, R.

    "text": "In a 2018 piece published in Poetics I adapted an approach to computing “reflective centralities” in two-mode data developed by Hidalgo & Hausmann (2009)—hereafter HH—to generalize basic formal notions in the study of cultural taste. Namely, “omnivorousness” on the side of people and “popularity” on the side of genres. The basic idea is that people can be characterized by the formal properties of the genres they choose (e.g., popularity versus nicheness) and genres can be characterized by the formal properties of the people who choose them (e.g., omnivores versus univores), at various levels of “reflections” (see the paper for more details).\nOf course, the HH reflective approach is not restricted to any type of data—although I would argue there is a particular elective affinity between this formalization and the substantive subject of cultural taste. In fact, it can be considered part of a family of reflective methods to compute the centralities of object in one node set in two-mode networks using relational information from the objects in the other node set.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1:  Southern Women Data. \n \n  \n      \n    E1 \n    E2 \n    E3 \n    E4 \n    E5 \n    E6 \n    E7 \n    E8 \n    E9 \n    E10 \n    E11 \n    E12 \n    E13 \n    E14 \n  \n \n\n  \n    EVELYN \n    1 \n    1 \n    1 \n    1 \n    1 \n    1 \n    0 \n    1 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    LAURA \n    1 \n    1 \n    1 \n    0 \n    1 \n    1 \n    1 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    THERESA \n    0 \n    1 \n    1 \n    1 \n    1 \n    1 \n    1 \n    1 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    BRENDA \n    1 \n    0 \n    1 \n    1 \n    1 \n    1 \n    1 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    CHARLOTTE \n    0 \n    0 \n    1 \n    1 \n    1 \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    FRANCES \n    0 \n    0 \n    1 \n    1 \n    1 \n    1 \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    ELEANOR \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    1 \n    1 \n    1 \n    1 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    RUTH \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    1 \n    1 \n    0 \n    1 \n    1 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    VERNE \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    1 \n    1 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    MYRA \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    1 \n    1 \n    1 \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    KATHERINE \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    1 \n    1 \n    1 \n    0 \n    1 \n    1 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    SYLVIA \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    1 \n    1 \n    1 \n    1 \n    0 \n    1 \n    1 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    NORA \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n    1 \n    1 \n    1 \n    1 \n    1 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    HELEN \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    1 \n    1 \n    0 \n    1 \n    1 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    OLIVIA \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    FLORA \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    PEARL \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n    1 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    DOROTHY \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    1 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n\n\nNote: \n\n Rows ordered according to the generalized blockmodeling solution of Doreian et al.

    "text": "Reflective Centralities of Persons and Groups\nTake the classic case of the duality of persons and groups (Breiger, 1974). At the first level, the most basic measure of centrality is degree centrality. Recall that a two-mode network composed of a set of people \\(P\\) and their affiliation relations to a set of groups \\(P\\) can be represented by an affiliation matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) of dimensions \\(|P| \\times |G|\\) with people along the rows and groups across the columns, where \\(|P|\\) is the cardinality of the people set and \\(|G|\\) is the cardinality of the group set, with cell entries \\(a_{pg}= 1\\) if person p is affiliated with group g and \\(a_{pg}= 0\\) otherwise.\nIn this case, the degree centrality of people is given by:\n\\[\n   C^R_p(1) = \\sum_g a_{pg}\n\\tag{1}\\]\nAnd for groups:\n\\[\n   C^R_g(1) = \\sum_p a_{pg}\n\\tag{2}\\]\nFor instance, for the classic Davis et al. (1941) Southern Women Data shown in Table 1, the centrality of the degree centralities of the people are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEVELYN\nLAURA\nTHERESA\nBRENDA\nCHARLOTTE\nFRANCES\nELEANOR\nRUTH\nVERNE\nMYRA\nKATHERINE\nSYLVIA\nNORA\nHELEN\nOLIVIA\nFLORA\nPEARL\nDOROTHY\n\n\n\n\n8\n7\n8\n7\n4\n5\n5\n5\n4\n4\n6\n7\n7\n5\n2\n2\n3\n2\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd for the groups:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE1\nE2\nE3\nE4\nE5\nE6\nE7\nE8\nE9\nE10\nE11\nE12\nE13\nE14\n\n\n\n\n3\n3\n6\n7\n8\n7\n10\n14\n12\n5\n4\n6\n3\n3\n\n\n\n\n\nThe key to the reflective approach, is the observation that, once we have these first-order quantities, it is possible to compute a “second order centralities” for both people and groups using the centralities of the other mode.\nFor people this is:\n\\[\n   C^R_p(2) = \\frac{1}{C^R_p(1)}\\sum_g a_{pg}C^R_g(1)\n\\tag{3}\\]\nAnd for groups:\n\\[\n   C^R_g(2) = \\frac{1}{C^R_g(1)}\\sum_p a_{pg}C^R_p(1)\n\\tag{4}\\]\nEquation 3 says “people are more central when the average membership of the groups they belong to is large” (e.g., \\(a_{pg} = 1\\) and \\(C^R_g(1)\\) is a big number). Equation 4 says “groups are more central when the average number of memberships of their members is large” (e.g., \\(a_{pg} = 1\\) and \\(C^R_p(1)\\) is a big number).\nOf course, we can keep on going and define third order reflections:\n\\[\n   C^R_p(3) = \\frac{1}{C^R_p(1)}\\sum_g a_{pg}C^R_g(2)\n\\tag{5}\\]\n\\[\n   C^R_g(3) = \\frac{1}{C^R_g(1)}\\sum_p a_{pg}C^R_p(2)\n\\tag{6}\\]\nEquation 5 says something like “people are more central when the average of the average number of memberships of the members of the groups they belong to is large” (e.g., \\(a_{pg} = 1\\) and \\(C^R_g(2)\\) is a big number). Equation 6 says something like “groups are more central when the average of the average number of members of the groups their members belong to is large” (e.g., \\(a_{pg} = 1\\) and \\(C^R_p(2)\\) is a big number).\nNote that for the people, the even numbered reflection \\(C^R_p(2)\\) assigns centrality based on a formal feature of the groups they belong to (in this case, their degree centrality). The odd numbered reflection \\(C^R_p(3)\\), on the other hand, assigns centrality based on a formal feature of the members of the groups they belong to.\nIn the same way, for the groups, the even-numbered reflection \\(C^R_g(2)\\) assigns centrality based on a formal feature of the people who belong to them (in this case, their degree centrality). The odd numbered reflection \\(C^R_g(3)\\), on the other hand, assigns centrality based on a formal feature of the groups their members they belong to.\nMore generally, we can define a series of reflective quantities for people and groups (whose verbal interpretation becomes more complex as the number of iterations increases):\n\\[\n   C^R_p(q) = \\frac{1}{C^R_p(1)}\\sum_g a_{pg}C^R_g(q-1)\n\\]\n\\[\n   C^R_g(q) = \\frac{1}{C^R_g(1)}\\sum_p a_{pg}C^R_p(q-1)\n\\tag{7}\\]\nFor all \\(q>1\\) (Hidalgo & Hausmann, 2009). This results in a series of vectors of reflective centrality scores for both people and groups across iterations \\(q =\\{1, 2, 3, ....Q\\}\\), which can be arranged into a \\(P \\times Q\\) matrix (for people) and \\(G \\times Q\\) matrix (for groups).\n\n\nhere() starts at C:/Users/Omar Lizardo/Google Drive/UCLA/mysite\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCr_2\nCr_4\nCr_6\nCr_8\nCr_10\nCr_12\nCr_14\nCr_16\nCr_18\nCr_20\n\n\n\n\nEVELYN\n15.0\n9.0\n7.0\n4.0\n5.0\n5.0\n5.0\n5.0\n5.0\n5.0\n\n\nLAURA\n16.0\n14.0\n10.0\n5.0\n3.0\n3.0\n3.0\n3.0\n3.0\n3.0\n\n\nTHERESA\n8.0\n7.0\n6.0\n7.0\n7.0\n7.0\n7.0\n7.0\n7.0\n7.0\n\n\nBRENDA\n11.0\n10.0\n8.0\n3.0\n4.0\n4.0\n4.0\n4.0\n4.0\n4.0\n\n\nCHARLOTTE\n13.0\n11.0\n9.0\n2.0\n2.0\n2.0\n2.0\n2.0\n2.0\n2.0\n\n\nFRANCES\n7.0\n6.0\n2.0\n1.0\n1.0\n1.0\n1.0\n1.0\n1.0\n1.0\n\n\nELEANOR\n6.0\n5.0\n3.0\n6.0\n6.0\n6.0\n6.0\n6.0\n6.0\n6.0\n\n\nRUTH\n4.0\n3.0\n5.0\n8.0\n8.0\n8.0\n8.0\n8.0\n8.0\n8.0\n\n\nVERNE\n3.0\n4.0\n11.0\n11.0\n11.0\n11.0\n11.0\n11.0\n11.0\n11.0\n\n\nMYRA\n5.0\n8.0\n12.0\n12.0\n13.0\n13.0\n13.0\n13.0\n13.0\n13.0\n\n\nKATHERINE\n17.0\n17.0\n17.0\n17.0\n17.0\n17.0\n17.0\n15.0\n15.0\n15.0\n\n\nSYLVIA\n14.0\n16.0\n16.0\n16.0\n16.0\n14.0\n14.0\n14.0\n14.0\n14.0\n\n\nNORA\n18.0\n18.0\n18.0\n18.0\n18.0\n18.0\n18.0\n18.0\n18.0\n18.0\n\n\nHELEN\n12.0\n15.0\n15.0\n15.0\n12.0\n12.0\n12.0\n12.0\n12.0\n12.0\n\n\nOLIVIA\n9.5\n12.5\n13.5\n13.5\n14.5\n15.5\n15.5\n16.5\n16.5\n16.5\n\n\nFLORA\n9.5\n12.5\n13.5\n13.5\n14.5\n15.5\n15.5\n16.5\n16.5\n16.5\n\n\nPEARL\n2.0\n2.0\n1.0\n9.0\n9.0\n9.0\n9.0\n9.0\n9.0\n9.0\n\n\nDOROTHY\n1.0\n1.0\n4.0\n10.0\n10.0\n10.0\n10.0\n10.0\n10.0\n10.0\n\n\n\nTable 2: Even numbered reflective centralities for people in the Southern Women Data"

Figure 1 and Figure 2 show such charts for the data corresponding to Table 2 and Table 3 respectively.1 As the tables show, in all cases, the rankings “freeze” after a relatively small number of iterations (\\(q \\approx 18\\))\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'cowplot'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:lubridate':\n\n    stamp\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Even numbered reflective centrality trajectories for actors in Southern Women Data.\n\n\n\n\nAs Figure 1 shows, \\(NORA\\), \\(FLORA\\), \\(CHARLOTTE\\) and \\(EVELYN\\) are the top-ranked actors when it comes to \\(C^R(2)\\): The average number of members of the groups they belong to. However, their fates in this reflective metric diverges at higher reflections, with Nora and Flora maintaining their top positions but \\(CHARLOTTE\\) and \\(EVELYN\\) tumbling down the ranks, suggesting that the members of the groups they belong to affiliate with smaller groups than the members of the groups \\(NORA\\) and \\(FLORA\\) belong to (and so on for higher reflections).\nNotably, the reflective centrality ranks at the highest reflection (\\(q = 20\\)) in Table 2, recovers the Doreian et al. (2004) block partition (see Table 1), but this time with Dorothy and Pearl in the middle separating the two largest blocks of women.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Odd numbered reflective centrality trajectories for actors in Southern Women Data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGroups\nFigure 3 and Figure 4 show the corresponding bump charts for the events. Just like for this actors, the equilibrium reflective centralities recover the ordering of the columns according to Doreian et al. generalized blockmodel with events 1-6 separated from events 10-15 by events 7-9 (see also Kovacs, 2010).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Even numbered reflective centrality trajectories for events in Southern Women Data.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3 shows that \\(E14\\) experiences the most dramatic improvement in status as we move to higher reflections. Relatively low ranked when it comes to the average number of memberships of its members, it increases in standing when considering the average of the average number memberships of its members (and so forth).\nThe most dramatic change in status is for \\(E1\\) in Figure 4, which begins as the top event when centrality is measured as the average size of the memberships of its members, but ends up dead last at higher reflections, suggesting that the average size of the events attended by the members of the groups its members belong to are smaller than other events (and so forth).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Odd numbered reflective centrality trajectories for events in Southern Women Data."

In this post, I showed the approach can reveal substantive meaningful patterns in the position of persons and groups in a classic two-mode network data set."

    "title": "Using Simple Correspondence Analysis to Present Tabular Data",
    "section": "",
    "text": "CA and Tabular Bias\nA lot of the time Simple Correspondence Analysis (here after CA) is presented as a complex, almost mystical technique, and its association with a relatively obscure data-analytic school in France and later Bourdieu’s Distinction does not help. This is a pity, since CA is actually a quantitative data reduction technique that is perfect for the presenting qualitative data. Particular data from samples typical of those that ethnographers, interviewers, small-sample content-analysts, and historical sociologists deal with frequently.\nA lot of the time, these researchers will present key pieces data in tabular form, and ask the readers to use a lot of brainpower to detect patterns by staring at numbers when it would be much easier to a do a simple CA and present the categories in the rows and columns of the table as a biplot of the first two-dimensions of a simple CA. I present three examples from published work showing this “tabular bias” and show how CA could have improved things greatly (and maybe revealed some insights).1 Note that picked these three articles not to drag them, but because I liked them quite a lot, and saw potential for them to be even better than they are.\n\n\nExample I: Journals and Theory Diagrams\n\n\n\nIn a fascinating piece, Brett et al. (2020) study the ways sociologists use diagrams to visualize theory ideas. They select seven primarily or heavily “theoretical” journals in sociology (p. 227), and coded the “theory figures” included in a random sample of papers from each journal. The theory figure codes aimed at specifying what sort of visual languages authors used to construct the visualizations (e.g., boxes, arrows, geometrical figures, Venn diagrams and the like). The tabular data is presented as an Appendix (A) to the paper. A two-mode table cross-classifying journals by the characteristics of the theory figures they typically publish These data are reproduced in Table 1. The table has seven rows (for the journals) and eleven columns (for the theory figure motifs)\n\n\n\n\nTable 1:  Table of journals by theory figure characteristics. \n \n  \n      \n    Arrows \n    Circles \n    Boxes \n    Lines \n    Triangles \n    Zig-Zags \n    Legend \n    Reading-Rules \n    Path-Diag. \n    Venn-Diag. \n    Con-Circles \n  \n \n\n  \n    AJS \n    7 \n    5 \n    3 \n    5 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    3 \n    1 \n    0 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    ASR \n    11 \n    4 \n    5 \n    19 \n    3 \n    1 \n    6 \n    11 \n    10 \n    1 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    EJS \n    14 \n    3 \n    14 \n    24 \n    1 \n    0 \n    3 \n    9 \n    10 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    EJST \n    9 \n    5 \n    5 \n    5 \n    4 \n    0 \n    0 \n    2 \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    ST \n    36 \n    34 \n    34 \n    24 \n    1 \n    4 \n    15 \n    3 \n    7 \n    17 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    TCS \n    5 \n    6 \n    6 \n    9 \n    3 \n    0 \n    2 \n    6 \n    2 \n    3 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    TS \n    23 \n    12 \n    12 \n    20 \n    0 \n    0 \n    8 \n    3 \n    9 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bulk of Brett et al.’s paper is concerned with specific examples, and the point is to delve into these to diagnose various problems in the ways sociologists use theory pictures (and end with some really good advice). Brett et al. were not concerned with the relationship between different journals and theory figure motifs, although they could have presented such data in a clear way by using a CA visualization of the table presented in the appendix. This is shown in Figure 1.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: CA Visualization of the table of journals by theory figure characteristics.\n\n\n\n\nThe Figure shows that the distribution of theory figure motifs across theory journals is not random, something that would be hard to tell from eyeballing the numbers in Table 1. Indeed, there is a pattern across journals, separating, on the main horizontal dimension, the American Sociological Review (ASR) and the European Journal of Sociology (EJS) on the one end from Sociological Theory (ST) at the other end. Both ASR and AJS are awash in lines and path-diagrams, while ST traffics heavily in circles (concentric and otherwise), zig-zags, boxes, and Venn diagrams. The American Journal of Sociology (AJS), square in the middle, balances between these two tendencies. The second dimension, on the other hand, separates the European Journal of Social Theory (EJST), which somehow gravitates towards triangles, from Theory & Society which likes legends. The arrows theory figure motif is neutral across journals, being placed close to the origin of the plot.2\n\n\nExample 2: Early Modern Authors in Economics\nErikson & Hamilton (2018)—hereafter EH—discuss how early modern economic thought arose out of the very practical reflections of people directly involved in trade, particularly international trade. As evidence consistent with this claim, they are argue that authors of early modern economics texts were disproportionately more likely to be recruited from certain classes, trades, and stations (e.g., merchants, especially those involved in international trade in chartered companies) as compared to others (Gentry, Army types). This merchant connection is supposed to strengthen over time (going from the sixteenth into the seventeenth century).\n\n\n\n\nTable 2:  Table of time periods by classes of early modern economics authors. \n \n  \n      \n    Noble \n    Gentry \n    Clergy \n    Military \n    Professional \n    Merchant \n    Yeoman \n  \n \n\n  \n    1550 \n    0 \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    1570 \n    0 \n    1 \n    2 \n    0 \n    14 \n    2 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    1590 \n    3 \n    4 \n    9 \n    1 \n    32 \n    6 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    1610 \n    4 \n    10 \n    16 \n    7 \n    35 \n    15 \n    2 \n  \n  \n    1630 \n    14 \n    38 \n    28 \n    22 \n    66 \n    38 \n    3 \n  \n  \n    1650 \n    22 \n    48 \n    40 \n    28 \n    103 \n    68 \n    11 \n  \n  \n    1670 \n    41 \n    49 \n    47 \n    12 \n    126 \n    65 \n    22 \n  \n  \n    1690 \n    123 \n    94 \n    97 \n    5 \n    222 \n    255 \n    3 \n  \n  \n    1710 \n    56 \n    48 \n    63 \n    5 \n    151 \n    205 \n    7 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nA key piece of evidence in this regard is presented in two-mode tabular form (Table 7, p. 140), reproduced here as Table Table 2. The table cross-classifies ten time-periods by seven classes of economics authors. EH invite the reader to gaze at the numbers to reach the desired conclusion (e.g, that there are more merchants in later periods). I argue that the reader would have reached the conclusion faster, and would have been even more convinced of their argument if they had used CA to present the results of their cross-classification. The reader may have also noticed patterns that are just impossible to see by staring at the table. This is shown in Figure 2.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: CA Visualization of the table of time periods by classes of early modern economics authors.\n\n\n\n\nThe figure shows evidence consistent with EH’s claims. Indeed, Merchants end up near the upper-left hand quadrant of the two-dimensional space, nearer the last two periods (1690-1710), indicating that they dominate the discussion during this era. They are maximally contrasted from authors with a military background (who are naturally better represented in more bellicose periods), and authors with a Yeoman background (who are better represented in the late sixteenth century). The CA also reveals insights not evident in the tabular presentation. First, Noblemen are also better represented among economics authors represented in the later period, even if they are less numerous than merchants. Second, clergymen are more or less evenly represented across periods, ending up close to the plot’s origins.\n\n\nExample 3: Relationship Between Class and Mode of Aesthetic Self-Presentation\nIn a fascinating paper, van den Haak and Wilterdink—hereafter HW—analyze interview data from a sample of ninety Dutch people more or less evenly divided into three groups by class sitaution: Stayers in the less educated stratum, stayers in the more educated stratum, and movers from the low to the high educated stratum. HW asked this people about their cultural tastes, other people’s cultural tastes, and whether there was such a thing as good and bad taste.\n\n\n\n\nTable 3:  Class status by mode of aesthetic self-presentation. \n \n  \n      \n    Only hierarchical \n    Only egalitarian \n    Both: ambivalent \n    Neither: neutral \n  \n \n\n  \n    Stayers (High Educ.) \n    2 \n    6 \n    22 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Movers (Low to High) \n    5 \n    3 \n    20 \n    2 \n  \n  \n    Stayers (Less Educ.) \n    1 \n    13 \n    13 \n    3 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you might imagine this resulted in a lot of “who am I to judge,” and “to each their own,” and “I wouldn’t want to sound rude,” and so forth. But the surprising thing is that HW also found that some non-substantial minority was not afraid to be judgy while the bulk of their sample shifted between judgy and “who am I…” discourses sometimes in the middle of the same thought!\nSo HW went back and coded their interview data (divided into the aforementioned classes) into different aesthetic self-presentation groups: People unafraid to produce hierarchical judgments of taste (e.g., “this type of culture is better than that other”), people who consistently stuck to the “who am I…, and to each…” script (egalitarians), and people who wavered between these two (ambivalents). There was also a neutral category for those who didn’t use any of these discourses.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: CA Visualization of the table of class status by mode of aesthetic self-presentation.\n\n\n\n\nHW presented their results in their Table 1 (p. 422), reproduced here (rows and columns switched) as Table 3. In summarizing their results, HW note that “[a]s Table 1 specifies, the well-educated are clearly over-represented in the hierarchical type and the (much larger) category of the ambivalent type, whereas the less-educated make up larger pro-portions of the egalitarian and the neutral categories (p. 422).” I think this definitely what the table shows, but it is not as evident as HW think because, well, table. A CA of the table would show the result in a better way. Moreover, CA is particularly efficient at summarizing results of two-way tables with a relatively small number of cases like Table 3.\nThe results are shown in Figure 3. Indeed, stayers among the educated stratum are the most likely to use the ambivalent discourse in HW’s data. In the same way, stayers in the less educated stratum are more consistently egalitarian (in nuanced ways that are better detailed in the paper), and also closer to the neutral pole (upper-right quadrant).\nHowever, what the CA plot also shows that is not that evident in the table is that movers into the educated stratum are also the most consistently hierarchical, perhaps in line with Bourdieu’s original thesis that late comers into cultural capital tend to adopt the party line in more rigid and less flexible forms—as detailed in Lizardo (2018).\n\n\nConclusion\nRhetorically, sociology is way past the “methods wars,” that characterized the bad old days. Mixed methods are quite normal, and people are used to deploying strategies that cross the qual/quant divide to answer questions and present data. Yet, some practices are encrusted in tradition, particularly the use of tabular data to present results. Both qualitative and quantitative people use them, but most of the time, a picture is going to be better.\nOne reason is that a two-way, two-mode table is a many-dimensional object (with as many dimensions as cells in the underlying matrix represented in the table) and it needs some reduction in dimensionality to be made comprehensible. Most of the time people reduce the dimensions informally (directing the reader’s attention to a particular column or percentage cell), but that means that they are bound to miss non-obvious patterns.\nCA can be used for many purposes, but the two things it is really good at is (1) reducing dimensionality usually to \\(d = 2\\), and (2) visualizing this reduction in a synoptic diagram (what Bourdieu loved about it). This conserves cognitive economy and maximizes impact. In the olden days CA was an obscure method ensconced in obscure software. Today, it is just a click away from the interface in all the popular data analysis programs (like R in the present case).\nSo whenever the urge to present something as a table occurs, especially at a key point in a paper, ask yourself: Wouldn’t CA tell a better story here? I bet in most cases it will.\n\n\nReferences\nBrett, G., Silver, D., & Beelen,, K. (2020). The right tool for the job: problems and solutions in visualizing sociological theory.
