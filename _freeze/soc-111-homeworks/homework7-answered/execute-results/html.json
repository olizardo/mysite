This shows the **ego-to-alter** ties in a hypothetical ego-network.\n\n- Consider @fig-ego-2. This shows the **alter-to-alter** ties in the hypothetical ego-network shown in @fig-ego-1.\n\n1. What is the **size** of ego's network?\n\nANSWER: 10\n\n2. What is the **effective size** of ego's network?\n\nANSWER: 6.8 `\n\n3. What is ego's **clustering coefficient**?\n\nANSWER: 0.356\n\n## Composition, Diversity, and Homophily\n\n\n\n::: {#fig-altersdem .cell layout-ncol=\"2\" fig-cap-location='margin'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Gender Identification of Alters.](homework7-answered_files/figure-html/fig-altersdem-1.png){#fig-altersdem-1 width=960}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Ethnoracial identification of alters.](homework7-answered_files/figure-html/fig-altersdem-2.png){#fig-altersdem-2 width=960}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Role relations of alters with Ego.](homework7-answered_files/figure-html/fig-altersdem-3.png){#fig-altersdem-3 width=960}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Employment status of alters.](homework7-answered_files/figure-html/fig-altersdem-4.png){#fig-altersdem-4 width=960}\n:::\n\nSocio-demographic Characteristics of Alters\n:::\n\n@fig-altersdem-1-@fig-altersdem-4 show some sociodemographic and role-relational characteristics of alters in ego's network. Ego is a *UCLA student who identifies as Asian and as a Woman*. Using this information:\n\n1. Compute Ego's EI **homophily** index with respect to gender identity.\n\nANSWER: 0.6\n\n2. Compute Ego's EI **homophily** index with respect to Ethnoracial identification.\n\nANSWER: 0.8\n\n\n3. Compute the **proportion** of neighbors in Ego's network.\n\nANSWER: 0.5\n\n\n4. Compute the **proportion** of people who identify as Hispanic in Ego's network.\n\nANSWER: 0.2\n\n5. Compute the **proportion** of fellow students in Ego's network.\n\nANSWER: 0.1\n\n\n6. Compute the **diversity** of Ego's Network with respect to ethnoracial identity.\n\nANSWER: 0.74\n\n7. Compute the **diversity** of Ego's Network with respect to employment status. \n\nANSWER: 0.7\n\n\n8. Compute the **diversity** of Ego's Network with respect to gender identity.\n\nANSWER: 0.7\n\n\n9. Does ego have a stronger **same-group preference** with respect to race than with respect to gender? (Yes/No, show your reasoning)\n\nANSWER: No (Gender EI = 0.6, versus Race EI = 0.8)\n\n\n10. Is the **diversity** of ego's network larger when it comes to race than when it comes to employment status  (Yes/No, show your reasoning)\n\nANSWER: Yes (Race H = 0.74, versus Employment H = 0.7)\n\n\n1. What is the **proportion** of ego's network composed of friends who are also Genderfluid?\n\nANSWER: 0.2\n\n\n1. Compute the **proportion** of people who identify as either Men or Women in ego's network. \n\nANSWER: 0.5\n\n",
