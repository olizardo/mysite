## From Graph to Matrix

- In the matrix below, write down the cell entries for the **adjacency matrix** corresponding to the graph shown in @fig-grex1:

```{r}
    a <- matrix(" ", nrow = 12, ncol = 12)
    rownames(a) <- LETTERS[1:12]
    colnames(a) <- LETTERS[1:12]
    diag(a) <- "----"
    kbl(a, format = "html", align = "c")  %>% 
         column_spec(1, bold = TRUE) %>% 
         column_spec (2:13, border_left = T, border_right = T) %>%
         row_spec(1:12, extra_css = "border-bottom: 1px solid") %>%
         kable_styling()
```
